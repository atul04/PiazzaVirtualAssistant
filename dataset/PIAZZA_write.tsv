jdfwf9hfubctg	Week 2/4 - 2/10	About marks for terrains traversed	Respected Sir/Ma'am The rulebook mentions that 100 points will be awarded for each terrain traversed, we would be really thankful if you could please tell us what qualifies as traversing a terrainproperly enough for it to be counted in the score. Does it need to be exactly on the line at all times, or does it simply mean that the robot shouldn't go off the line. For example, our robot, at steep turns, starts turning before the actual turn so that it may turn properly, is it fine or not? Thanking you Team PB#4097	02-09-2018	planter_bot,Planter_Bot

jd535xxfwbn4en	Week 1/28 - 2/3	Similarity of arena to the one given right now	Respected Sir/Ma'am Quoting Questions @1443 and @1140 , On my last question, Avijit sir answered  We have providedan arena design. Features like line thickness, types of terrain, cell size etc will remain same in the arena.  Based on the physical orientation of the camera, the line thickness visible to the robot will vary. Students are free to position the PiCam on the Planter Bot according to theirown design choice.  Based on the positioning of the PiCam,things liketrigonometric calculations etc will also change.  We would be really grateful if you could tell us if the arena in the finals would be same as the one we have right now?  Also, it would be a really great help if you could please tell that do the different terrains really mean anything in context of arena, like is the orderpre-determined and we can hardcode optimised algorithms to traverse that particular terrain, or the names given to the terrain just imply real life implementations and the robot has to traverse arena normally with the normal algorithm it is using to traversing the rest of the arena.

And check ip address. It shows: Ip address=192.168.43.48 Gateway=192.168.43.1 14) now I have opened the dhcpcd.conf file and add the following lines: Interface eth0 Ip address=192.168.43.20 Router address=192.168.43.1 Domain_name_server=192.168.43.1 Interface wlan0 Ip address=192.168.43.21 Router address=192.168.43.1 Domain_name_server=192.168.43.1  And save and close the file.  15) now takeout sd card and connect it to pi and wait for 3 minutes for booting . 16) now open mobaxterm,click on ssh and write host as 192.168.43.21 Then ok 17) but every time it gives connection time out.

But in Task 1A we deleted one line by mistake which was to display the colour in the output image. Rest are displayed correctly . The csv file is as required containing the color as well. Only we deleted the line cv2.putText() for displaying color by mistake in the output image only. We were afraid that if we reupload now, we had to pay penalty for that. Should we leave it as it is or shall we reupload it?  There was another doubt. We used an algorithm of detecting four point objects (eg. Rhombus and trapezium) by comparing with existing templates of rhombus and trapezium. Rest objects are detected just by no. of points (sharp ends) of the objects. So for this we also uploaded a ""Templates"" folder containing the two images for comparison. This folder is there where the ""Task1(A/B)_main.py"" exists. I hope this doesn't create any problem.
