drone not increase in height	hi drone too do n't go above certain height actually fly well during the first few day but not now maybe due to unavoidable crash so try remove propeller guard as be kind of loose and the drone actually work well so the problem may be with the improper leveling of propeller guard may be loose or obstruct propeller so try fly the drone without that note possible damage may occur to propeller on crash maybe can order or eyantra team may resolve motor may have be not place firmly in holder propeller may have be loose if nothing work reassemble the entire drone again battery would discharge from to drastically when fly the drone but rise to good height so do n't think battery be the problem the above tweak may or may not work as may have completely different scenario if can find the real root cause of this problem please post about hope this may help all the good
behaviour of drone	sir team even at full charge battery when give throttle value go up but in backward direction and then even when the code be send the command to go right do n't go just go up around cm and then rush backward think be due to motor so replace the motor but the problem persist then replace the propeller but this also do n't solve calibrate multiple time with different phone but still the problem persist each time the calibrate value be good the pitch be roll be and yaw be around have also check with the script provide the when press the drone go up around cm and then rush backward one thing notice be that when do the motor test the drone circle in one direction the link of the video show problem https //youtu.be tydcr dyfmg

failure in perform task	respected sir although try good be not able to do the task- in the give time now past the deadline so want to sumarise all the problem that face while do the task so that atleast can get to know where go wrong and what be the good way to approach the problem be easily able to maneuver the drone through python code since the begin hard code version of code armed disarm make the drone reach hieght and move in various direction easily.- so next step be to apply the pid algorithm observation the maximum error be get in any case be so the value of the derivator term be always in between in any case for start the pid tuning avoid take in the integral part as be summission of all the error upto give point which usually come out to be very large so pid error derivator now start tune with an initial value of and which have use for tuning of virtual drone- the resultant pid come out in the range of but the value require for motion of drone should be in between so make an equation such that output send to the motor pid some constant value so now observe that this value varied for different axis and for different quadrant for eg require be different for axis and -ve axis so code as such so as to provide differnt value for different axis and different quadrant so start tune drone for one axis at time but while determine the perfect value of this the battery usually discharge and once change the battery the value of change so everytime change the battery would tune the drone just again determine the value of again for all the axis anew and these value be always different so assume that change the battery effect the value of so after tune the drone in each axis for give battery would run code for combined value for both and for the drone to reach the setpoint and drone do usually reach setpoint but when enhance the code for hold the drone would not hold would start oscillate and sometimes exbhite random behaviour but usually uptill this point the battery would discharge and repeat the process again for new battery persist the same thing for few day without any result then on one of the run observe that the value of be change accord to the point where tune from i.e if be tune the drone from point which be near to the setpoint then the value of require be high while if the tuning of be do from far point then the value of would be less.- thus the observation be make that when point be quite far from the set point the error be large thus pid value be large for this point so from here drone require comparitively less speed to stably reach the set point while when point be close to setpoint the pid value be not large enough to make the drone reach the setpoint so the value of require here be large so now be require to modify the code as such so let take the case of ve axi for this output pid value so now when pid value be small the drone get high magnitude for motion while for far away point the pid value would be large and thus would move slowly and stably to destination this strategy work but only for half of the plane and lot ambiguity exist resultantly now the drone be not even reach the setpoint properly let alone hold there in the whole case also work for varied value of and use rqt_plot for ensure fine tuning and research lot abot pid tuning of drone but without any fruit and discharging of drone battery in just minute be major issue so the whole process be very tiresome and fruitless as finally be not able to submit any video work really hard for this task so through this post just expect few remark as to what be the correct way to perform the task as be sure that miss very important point team eyrc

hint and tip for interface hardware with spark and firebird	dear participant the following be some hint and tip for interface hardware with the robot color sensor for interface color sensor with spark will need to access additional gpio to connect and can remove the lcd from the spark robot and use the pin for interface the color sensor.read about timer input capture mode in atmega to interface color sensor with atmega use the same color paper for cover the plant as the sample provide to many team in task have use othershadesof color paper which will be pain for thresholding.t color sensor for different distance range and apply thresholde accordingly the pulse count vary drastically aas the distance change sharp sensor for interface the sharp sensor with spark use the slot provide for ultrasonic sensor on the spark v. read the spark hardware manual details.you need to enable the ultrasonic sensor slot by change the jumper first before interface xbee instruction to configure xbee in at mode have be give in the hardware testing folder.for the zigbee firmware be use there be only two mode for zigbee configuration coordinator /end point configure all xbee in network as end point will work fine for communication be not necessary that one of need to be configure as coordinator.you can use any other zigbee firmware or mode as well if want.go through the experiment folder athttp //elsi.e yantra.org resourcesto study the zigbee example codexbee act wireless uart link once properly configure so read in detail about uart communicationthe firebird have uart port out of which xbee be connect on uart portspark have only one uart port so xbee and usb be multiplexe out of the same port need to switch the usb xbee jumper to switch between mode servo need to study about timer and pwm to find out howto interface servos.there be slot already provide for servo connection on spark v. read the manual and datasheet to know the timer be connect to and how to configure the timerfor the spark be recommend only drive micro servo use the robot since the standard servo draw lot of current which can not be supply by the spark battery white line follow apply proper thresholding for each of the white line sensor.you can adjust the intensity of red lead use the potentiometer provide will add more to this section as think of pin
regard color sensor	dear participant if any of color sensor or all of color sensor seem to be faulty then kindly send video of the testing the video testing must show the pin connection of the respective pin as well many team be just show the lcd of the bot with different colored paper but if connection be not proper then also will not be able to see the proper reading so please post the video with the above mention point into consideration all of must post team and number of sensor seem faulty pin
