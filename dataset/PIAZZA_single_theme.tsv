jcul5ep07xs4e3	motor replacement	https://robokits.co.in/motors/encoder-dc-servo/high-precision-quad-encoder-geared-dc-motor-12v-60rpm I bought the motor from this link which was provided by the instructor. But at 100% duty cycle,it turns much slower than the motor provided in the kit.When i checked the rpm (using stopwatch) i found that the new motor which I bought turns at 60 rpm but the motor provided in the kit turns at 150 rpm. So when I searched for motors in nex robotics, I found this:  http://www.nex-robotics.com/products/motors-and-accessories/150rpm-side-shaft-dc-gear-motor-with-position-encoder.html  I believe that this is the exact same motor as provided in the kit. I request the instructors to confirm as soon as possible  	planter_bot

jbka82dri2h1dk	Error in GUI testing of firebird V	TEAM ID: eYRC#3883  When testing for motion control the robot using the gui testing software, the robot is working well in both the forward and the right direction. But in the backward and left direction the speed of the left motor is very less when compared to the right motor. So the robot is not moving in the required direction. How to solve this problem ?  Since you have requested for a short video of the same. Here is the link to the video: Error in GUI testing of firebird  In this video, you can see that firebird bot is working well in forward and right direction.But,in backward and left direction, you can also see that the speed of the left motor is very less when compared to right motor.Because of which, bot is not moving in the specified direction. How to solve this problem ?   Thank you in advance!!	harvester_bot
jbjh9re5a5g4vr	Values obtained in the left white-line sensor not matching with expected values	We know that the Firebird V has 3 white line sensors underneath it. So,while testing the bot's sensors we found that when we provide a complete black surface to these white line sensors (such that each sensor should give almost equal analog outputs), Two of the three white line sensor give almost the same value but the third sensor gives a significantly lesser analog value.  Kindly look into the drive link. We are confused whether this is normal or is a serious issue, as it can possibly lead to inaccuracies.  link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jAA0Pluw5xv8-PZIjoTjzT6P-t_uSr5u	harvester_bot
