jepajdyfulx3nj,Pinned,        Collector Bot,"Dear Finalists,
 
Congratulations!!
 
Please note the following points during the implementation in Finals:
 
1. You will not be awarded marks for FV unless you mark the current target in blue colour in V-REP.
2. Remember that there are bonus marks of 200 allotted for realistic emulation of the scenario in V-REP.
3. The Rule 4 under Re-position rules which says ""If Fruits in Collection Area are displaced, they are placed back in the original locations. If this is caused by collision with CB, teams will be penalized according to the Judging and Scoring parameters."" is replaced with the new rule, ""If in any case, Fresh fruit gets displaced/falls and you feel that you will not be able to detect it further, then e-Yantra team will remove the displaced Fresh Fruit on your request. If the displaced Fresh fruit is not removed, the penalty will be incurred on collision with CB or Truck""
4. All teams should use PWM greater than 210 for Truck's black line following. Also, make sure that the Truck stops at all the collection stations for only 10 seconds and not more than that.
5. Make sure that you fully charge the Truck and CB before the run.
6. You should strictly follow the Re-position rules as mentioned in Rulebook. You are not allowed to change the position of the fruits.
7. As mentioned in the Rulebook, The run will end if you display the text ""FRUITS COLLECTED"" on a pop up window in V-REP. No marks will be awarded after you display the same.
8. Penalty is incurred each time when the CB touches/ displaces any other object in the arena except the current target.
   E.g.: Even if any part of CB touches the already collected fruit or Truck, then the penaty will be incurred.
 
All the best!!

Dear Participants,
 
The competition closes on 26th February, 11:59 PM.
 
Hence, teams who had downloaded their Original configuration well before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM can still submit their task before the competition closes with penalty as per the policy on portal.
 
Teams who downloaded the configuration just before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM have only 48 hours to submit their task. No submission for Original configuration or for Code submission will be considered (even via an email) after 26th February, 11:59 PM.
 
Hence, we request teams to kindly pace up their work and avoid last moment rush.
 
Teams should submit their Original task with Code well before the deadline, maybe by 9 or 10 PM tomorrow. Many teams try to submit their task at the last moment due to which the server gets loaded and then they aren't able to submit their task on time. So, please avoid such situations for your benefit.
 
 
You can download the Bonus configuration even with penalty or zero score on Original configuration till 26th Feb, midnight.


 

But, the last date to submit the video for Bonus task is 26th Feb, midnight. Though there is no penalty for Code and Bonus video submission, the submission won't be considered after 26th Feb midnight.
 
All Teams kindly note this, no extensions will be entertained in any case.
 
 
Thank you.

It was mentioned in the Rulebook that you would be given final_arena.ttt in Task4. As most of the work has been done by you, we are not going to give any .ttt file. Make sure you follow the minimum conventions mentioned in Rulebook. You are free to add any dummy or object.
 
Keep in mind that there will be marks for creativity in finals. Creativity is the measure of how exactly your simulation arena represents the original scenario. E.g., Texture of garden, road, collection stations, Fresh and Damaged Fruits shown with different textures etc. 
 
Though there is no weightage for creativity now(in video submission), we recommend you to work on the asthetics of the simulation from now.
 
Note: Successful run ends when CB deposits all the fresh fruits in the Truck and a pop up window appears in the V-REP with the text “FRUITS COLLECTED”.

Based on your work in Task 3, we have arranged to have a progress video to be submitted by your team. While preparing this video, you will learn about a crucial problem that has been overlooked by many of you and will assist you in completing the theme implementation.
 
In this video, the drone should land on a whycon marker placed anywhere on the arena. The following steps must be carried out:
 
1. Place the drone at the HOME position as given in the rule book.
2. Place a whycon marker anywhere on the arena (preferably, at a good distance from HOME) .
3. The drone must take off and travel to the marker.
4. The drone must land on the marker.
 
By doing this, we can ensure that teams are on the right path while implementing the theme. This progress video is not mandatory, but highly recommended. Teams will not be graded on this video. Based on this video, we may be able to provide certain inputs to assist you, if need be. Deadline for submitting this video is 8th Feb 2018. Details of recording and uploading this video is available on the portal.
 
We hope to see teams complete this progress video and work towards successfully implementing the theme.

As lots of participants are facing the battery related issue. We are extending the deadline of the task3 till 19th jan 2018. Teams who has already submitted the task 3, they can improve their solution and who has submitted the task well and good before the 9th jan 2018 they will definitely get some bonus marks.
 
You might  know, we have very less time to complete the theme. Here are some important task you need to understand and complete.
 
1. Waypoint navigation : After completion of drone holding, Complete the waypoint navigation of drone. Give some waypoints in the code and Navigate the drone to those waypoints.
Challenges: Navigation of drone in the corner waypoints of frame.
Hint: Set some offset for the corner cases.
 
2. Landing the drone on static marker: After completing the first point. Try to land the drone on static marker. Fix the marker somewhere in the arena and try to land the drone on that marker. Again change the position of marker and so on.
Challenge: 1.  When two markers are in the frame. correct identification of drone marker and second marker(static).
                  2. When one marker overlap on the another, there will be no detection for single marker(because your target is changed from 2 to1).
Hint: Use the whycon/reset service to change the target in run time.
 
3. Line(path) follow of runner: Write a code for runner that runner follow the path given in the runner list. We have written the code for your ease and you can downloaded the code from here line_follow_sparkv.zip. This Folder contain the code block project
Challenges: Thresholding of the sensor.Hint: Carefully analyse the Sensor value and decide the thresholding.
 
4. Landing of drone while runner is moving: Try to land the drone while runner is moving in the arena. (first try without caves).
Challenges: Increasing the accuracy of drone to land when runner is waiting at node for 2 seconds.
Hint: Use the laser sensor on drone and whycon z coordinate data with filter to check drone is on the above of Runner.
5. Action when Runner enter into cave: Detection of cave from code. Take a appropriate action.
Challenge: Detection of Cave: Because there is no marker on the cave.
Hint: You can Choose accroding to accuracy.6. Detection of Drone sucessfull landing on Runner: Using Sensor you have to detect the landing of drone on the runner, Runner Should stop when drone lands on the Runner.
Challenges: Placement of sensor on runner to detect the landing of drone.
Hint: Check the scoring formula. And make the effort according to time and acrruracy
 
Complete the above task one by one for theme implementation.
 
Teams who are facing the problem due to battery of drone. They can start performing the task mentioned in step 3.

Congratulations guys, all of you are doing great work. Those who have yet to submit Task 3, don't get discouraged. You still have a good chance to get into finals. Submit it soon to avoid further penalty.
 
Now it is time to increase your pace. Indeed you have a lot of time to implement the theme, but if you end up wasting your time now hoping to do it in last week or so, i assure you that you will end up wasting a golden opportunity to win the competition. So pedal up now and accelerate towards success and grab that opportunity.
 
Following are some of the important factors you need to consider while implementing the task:
Placement of camera with respect to arenaRobot chassis design for CB
Material for constructionDistribution of weight or position of C.GDifferential drive mechanismOverall size of the robot
Placement of ArUco marker on CBArm design in CB
Actuators (You can use the provided servo motors or any other actuators you want with the consent of e-yantra team)Required Degree of Freedom for armPicking and Dropping location of arm
Implementing P,P-D or PID control for motion
Starting PWM of motorsDetermination of offsetMapping PWMTuning of Kp, Kd or KiBest method to Debug to see if CB is following the path or not (hint: link)
Designing of Bin for Truck
Material for constructionSize of BinPosition of Bin with respect to SparkVPosition of Bin at collection stationsWeight of Truck with Fruits
Position of ArUco marker on TruckNumber of Fruits to be deposited in Truck at a time
Pros and cons of having a collection mechanism in CB itself and dropping multiple fruits in Truck at one goComplexity of design.
AVR programming for ATmega2560 Development Board in arduino IDE or any other IDE's like atmel studio.
Timer programmingPWMGetting familiar with the UART library provided to you for sending data serially

With the completion of Task 4, you will be heading towards the Theme implementation. The only task left over will be Theme implementation and sending a video of your implementation with the arena configuration provided (the details will be conveyed soon).
 
Teams are expected to start brainstorming and think in this direction:
 
1. How the Transmitter and Receiver system must be designed for the final Spotter Snake.
 
2. What components are necessary and how they must be interfaced in both these systems. How communication will be established successfully, i.e. exchange of data between controller and robot. This is the most important aspect and teams must start implementing this as soon as their Task 4 is completed.
 
3. The weight distribution of various components on the Snake's body so as to balance them all while it is maneuvering on the given arena.
 
4. Implementing tasks to be completed by Snake robot while traversing the arena and planning a strategy to score and fetch maximum marks as per the scoring formula, keeping all the Rules in mind.
 
5. The last step that can help you reach in Finals.. Practice, practice and practice! After writing scripts, team must practice by traversing the Snake robot on the arena, so as to avoid penalties and get more marks.
 
 
The 3D printed brackets will reach to teams by 20th January. Teams are expected to think and plan on the above points and can then execute their plan as they receive their printed brackets.
 
 
All the Best..!!
 
 
Happy Learning!
Cheers!

Dear Participants,
 
For your Task 3 submission, see to it that the .zip file size is less than 30 MB. Our portal is able to take files of this size only.
 
But, still if your file size is greater than 30 MB then you must upload
 
If the .zip file of your Task 3 submission is greater than 30 MB then you must upload your files on this google form.
 
Teams who have uploaded their Task 3 on the google form, see whether file size is within the limit mentioned and upload accordingly. We are deleting all the responses of google form recorded so far.
 
You can upload Task 3 submission multiple times on both portal as well as google form.
 
But, please make note do NOT upload your Task 3 submission on both portal and google form. If found so, we would not encourage.
 
The last uploaded Task 3 on portal and google form before 3rd January, 2017 at 11:59 pm will be considered as final submission.
 
 
Though, you can fill the 3D Printing Details only once. So, kindly make note of this and do not get confused.
 
We would suggest each team to kindly complete Task 3 and submit it before the deadline to avoid last minute confusion.
 
 
Thank you.

Hard deadline to submit the Task 3 and SS hardware testing video is Wednesday, 3rd January 2018, 11:59 pm.

But you should try to submit the designs as soon as possible so that you can get 3D printed parts as soon as possible. It will buy you more time for upcoming tasks.
 
For teams that have not received printed parts till now, you must utilize your time in developing and building joystick. Communication between snake and joystick is going to be next big challenge.

Dear Participants,
 
As you complete the debugging of your Spotter Snake model and start video recording of the simulation, you'll use the Video Recorder tool for recording (as instructed in video tutorial -- Part 2: Submission Instructions).
 
When you use that tool, kindly uncheck the box that says: ""Hide Information Text"". This will show the information regarding the collisions detected, the simulation time (relative to the real time) and other simulation parameters on top of the scene.
 
Kindly do not forget this before recording the video of the simulation and submitting on YouTube.

We have observed that many teams have submitted a video that is edited and/or also have used some video editing tools to fasten the simulation. Teams have also submitted videos where the Information Text is hidden, despite of instructing many times... We have no other option than deducting marks for such teams and loose them in Stage 2 even though their designs were good enough.

If such teams still want to be live in the competition than kindly re-upload the YouTube video link as sooner as you can.
 
Thank you.

Dear Participants,
 
Greetings from e-Yantra!
 
Hope you're on the path to complete Task 1.2 and submit the same before time. We have received many submissions in Task 1.1 and also expect that at least all those teams submit Task 1.2 successfully. We also expect those teams who were not able to submit Task 1.1 on time, are completing both tasks and will too submit it by 28th November, 11:59 pm.
 
Gear up your speed and manage your time by properly scheduling your other tasks and studies along with the competition. This will help you keep balance between both and succeed in submitting tasks before time.
 
All the Best !! Cheers!
 
 
Regarding 3D Printing Details:
 
As you have completed Task 1.1 and are simulating the snake model in Task 1.2, you might have done slight modifications to your design based on the feedback provided for Task 0 submission and also based on the V-REP simulation.
 
We have asked to resubmit your final brackets and 3 servo motors design assembly (only .f3d) along with Task 1.2. Kindly note you save the scene file (.ttt) and the design assembly file (.f3d) in .zip folder having the same name as instructed. Please do not zip your files in any other format other than .ZIP
 
 
Once you have your final bracket designs ready, you will be ready with all the details for 3D printing the brackets, (the types of brackets, quantity of each bracket to be printed, volume of each bracket and total brackets to hold 3 servo motors). Go to the portal and find the page ""3D Printing Details"".
 
Only the team leader can fill these details.
 
Kindly provide correct address of team leader along with State and Pincode where you want the 3D printed brackets to be shipped. We advise to not provide your institute's address as it will cause unnecessary delay in you receiving the brackets, if the institute is closed on the day when the brackets are shipped to the location.
 
Kindly read the ""3D PRINTING INSTRUCTIONS"" on the same page carefully. Note that you have to submit the .stl and .step files of each bracket type separately with each file having the names as instructed in Instructions file.
 
Also, kindly note that you have to submit these files in a folder with the given name and ZIP them. Kindly upload only .ZIP file having all the .stl and .step files of your bracket types. Before exporting the bracket component into .stl and .step, DO NOT FORGET TO ENGRAVE YOUR TEAM_ID on each bracket component. If no TEAM_ID is found on your brackets, then even if you complete Task 1 successfully and are eligible to qualify for Stage 2, your brackets won't be 3D printed and your team will be disqualified.
 
 
KINDLY FILL THE DETAILS ON PORTAL VERY CAREFULLY, AS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REFILL THE DETAILS LATER. e-Yantra will not be responsible for any discrepancy in this matter. We suggest that team leader verifies all the details with 2 team members before submitting.
 
Thank you for your cooperation.

We tried to debug it till now and we couldn't, looks like they malfunctioned and our original deadline closed at 10:30 today.
I have attached the code we worked on and few videos of our snake bot performing various gaits.We have put in a lot of effort into our bot, please consider it and give us a deadline extension to work with, we have ordered nrf modules and it'll be delivered to us within two days and we just have to attach it with our controller and take a video of our bot performing a perfect run. We have also uploaded the progress video, kindly take a look at it.​ We have also mailed the code and video to helpdesk@e-yantra.org
Hoping for a positive response from you,

jdsftgv66sb64r,Week 2/18 - 2/24,      SparkV Code,"sir, 
it may be a little rude but i would like to ask if the code you sent for line follower is tested or not.because when we tried following line through it by making a few changes (threshold values and other comparing values) it won't give expected result.it has many problems,when checking logic carefully, and observing field values we have found out that1. At any conditions black and green have around same values(5-10 points gap )2. The black line is so thin, ADC conversion takes too much time to get new value and black line is skipped at speed 200+3. The distance between green and black line is actually somehow matching the distance between right and left white line sensor and hence its not able to detect at what position it is (the right white line or left white line)4.also the position of one buzzer is interfering with proper sensitivity of one sensor(its black colored and always gives more values then other)5. due to less thickness, black line gives less values compared to green (when sensor is on green, it will be absorbed more  while when on black it will get partially absorbed and partially reflected from side white color if i try to follow line based on black line then logic gets completely reverted if by mistake or due to any above reasons the sensor detect edge of green area as black line
if i try to follow line based on green area with outside sensors then it will show dumping a lot and misses the node..so please will you be kind enough to tell me if this code is tested or not so that i can decide whether i should figure out any more special conditions to make your code work for me or should i write my own code for this.Time is running out and i have already spent a lot of time on that code.should i give it one more try if its worth it or is it just for reference and getting familiar with sensor's configuration...thank you",2/18/18,"chaser_drone,nex_robotics"

As a result, the drone starts moving in RIGHT due to roll when Roll=1500, BUT when algo reduces roll to1350, the drone stabilizes in Roll.
Same is with the Pitch as well.
Each time the error in Roll and Pitch changes and hence 1350 value also changes.
When drone is on flat surface, the Roll varies from -13 to -8 . And pitch varies from 2 to 8 .
# In pluto App, we can trim the values so that error in Roll and Pitch can be rectified, but in programming trimming can't be done without knowing the relation.
So during tuning, when error in coordinates is zero, output does not affect the 1500, but drone shows a very sensitive motion still then in Roll and Pitch.

Our drone too didn't go above certain height. It actually flew well during the first few days but not now (maybe due to unavoidable crashes). So, we tried removing propeller guards as it was kind of loose and the drone actually worked well. So, the problem might be with the:
1. improper leveling of propeller guards. They might be loose or obstructing your propellers. So try flying the drone without that (NOTE: possible damage may occur to your propellers on crash. maybe you can order them or Eyantra team may resolve them)
2. Motors may have been not placed firmly in their holder
3. Propellers may have been loose
If nothing works, reassemble the entire drone again.
(Our battery would discharge from 4.2 to 3.6 V drastically when flying the drone, but it rose to a good height. So, we don't think battery is the problem. The above tweaks may or may not work as you might have a completely different scenario)
 
If you can find the real root cause of this problem, please post about it.

Even at full charged battery when we give a throttle value, it goes up but in backward direction and then even when the code is sending the command to go right it doesn't go, it just goes up around 10-15cm and then rushes backward. We thought it was due to motors so we replaced the motors but the problem persisted then we replaced the propellers but this also didn't solve it. We calibrated it multiple times with different phones but still the problem persisted. Each time the calibrated values were good the pitch was 0 roll was 0 and yaw was around 3.
 
We have also checked with the script you provided the when we press 'w' the drone goes up around 10cm and then rushes backward.

However,  sometimes, it just works all of a sudden and gives us false hope. We don't think battery is the problem because it shows 4.2 to 3.7 V. Moreover, the yaw calibration is required often. Please resolve our issues and let us know what might be the actual problem so that we can correct it.

Dear Participants,
 
1. There are a variety of wheels available in the market that can be used in your iteration of Spotter Snake. Some of the examples are attached below.

 
 
2. Always make sure your battery monitoring circuit is connected to the battery while you are working with it. This will prevent battery damage by indicating battery status.
 

All the Best..!!
 
 
Happy Learning!

jc94murx4e378e,Week 1/7 - 1/13,      Failure in performing Task - 3,"Respected sir,Although we tried our best, we were not able to do the Task-3 in the given time. Now its past the deadline so I want to sumarise all the problems that we faced while doing the task so that atleast we can get to know where we went wrong and what was the best way to approach the problem.
-> We were easily able to maneuver the drone through python code since the begining. Our hard coded version of code armed, disarmed, made the drone reach hieght and move in various directions easily.-> So our next step was to apply the PID algorithm.
# Observations:1. The maximum error we were getting in any case was [-8,8]2. So, the value of the derivator term was always in between [-8,8] in any case3. For starting the PID tuning we avoided taking in the Integral part ( as it is summission of all the errors upto a given point) which usually came out to be very large.4. So PID = P*error + D*derivator
-> Now I started tuning with an initial value of P=0.4 and D=0.7, which I had used for tuning of my virtual drone-> The resultant PID came out in the range of (-5, 5)-> But the values we required for motion of drone should be in between [1000, 2000]-> So I made an equation such that -> [output sent to the motor] = 1500 (+/-) PID*(some constant value -> A)
-> So now we observed that this value A varied for different axis and for different quadrants :  For eg A required was different for +x axis and -ve x axis. So I coded it as such, so as to provide differnt A values for different axis' and different quadrants So we started tuning our drone for one axis at a time But while determining the perfect value of this A the battery usually discharged and once we changed the battery the values of A changed So everytime we changed the battery we would tune the drone just again -> determined the value of A again for all the axis anew( and these values were always different -> so we assumed that changing the battery effected the value of A) So after tuning the drone in each axis for a given battery we would run our code for combined value( for both x and y) for the drone to reach the setpoint And drone did usually reached its setpoint But when we enhanced the code for HOLDING, the drone would not hold.. it would start oscillating and sometimes exbhited random behaviour But usually uptill this point, the battery would discharge and we repeated the process again for a new battery -> We persisted the same thing for a few days without any result
-> Then on one of the run we observed that the values of A were changing according to the point where we tune it from, i.e,  If we are tuning the drone from a point which is near to the setpoint then the value of A required was high while if the tuning of A was done from a far point then the value of would be less.-> Thus the observation was made that when point is quite far from the set point ( the error was large..... thus PID value is large for this point ) so from here drone requires a comparitively lesser speed to stably reach the set point....... while when point was close to setpoint the PID value was not large enough to make the drone reach the setpoint so the value of A required here was larger.  So now we were required to modify the code as such.....  so lets take the case of +ve x axis -> for this -> output = 1600 - PID value -> so now when PID value was small the drone got higher magnitude for motion while for far away points the PID value would be large and thus would move slowly and stably to destination. -> This strategy worked but only for half of the plane......... and lots ambiguities existed.  Resultantly now the drone was not even reaching the setpoint properly let alone HOLDING there. In the whole case we also worked for varied values of P and D, used rqt_plot for ensuring fine tuning and researched a lot abot PID tuning of a drone but without any fruit And discharging of drone batteries in just 2 - 3 minutes was a major issue  So the whole process was very tiresome and fruitless as finally we were not able to submit any video. We worked really hard for this task  So through this post I just expect a few remarks as to what was the correct way to perform the task as we are sure that we missed a very important point Team ID: eYRC#582",1/10/18,"chaser_drone,drona_aviation,Chaser Drone"

        We have written our own script to perform the given task (to arm the drone and take off with PID values). The drone arms itself but doesn't takes off always. Sometimes it does but most times it just arms itself and becomes unresponsive!!
We have tried several combinations but it doesn't seem to work out. Kindly help us by providing appropriate cause of this behaviour.",1/6/18,"chaser_drone,drona_aviation,Chaser Drone"

But when i am applying this value to sparkv in vrep , the sparkv os fluctuating too much.
Moreover the  value which i am reading from aruco marker is 87 to 90, but when i am applying this value to sparkv in vrep , it is showing value 95 and suddenly it is going to -157 and then back to 95, as a result the sparkv is orientation is fluctuating too much.

1) When Drone is in motion for a some time camera stop detecting the co-ordinates of marker on Drone and due to that its starts moving randomly.
     Is it happening due to lights intensity in room?
2)  Do we have apply PID for x,y,z in same function or separately? Because on applying PID in X and Y with 1500 +- 100(approx) its showing a random motion.
     and On applying PID only in Z there is also some movements in X and Y axis tough roll and pitch is given 1500(exact).
3)  On moving to some Z position and calling reset function the drone shows some random motion.
      Reset fun(): roll = 1500 , pitch =1500 , yaw =1500, throttle=1500.
      Is reset function is used to stabilize drone in current position?
