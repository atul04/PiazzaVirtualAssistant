jt5fafsmk7k2k4,Pinned,      [IMPORTANT] Instructions for finalists,"Dear Participants,
 
We hope that you have gone through @2384 enlisting some of the important points you need to take care during your finals.
 
This post is to inform you regarding the procedure by which we will be setting up the arena in finals.
 
You will be allowed to practise on the arena once it is setup. The location of the practise arena will be same as that of the final arena.You will have to bring Top of the Food trees (refer rulebook) alongwith WhyCon and ArUco markers . We will only provide you with base of the trees with sticker d (for food trees) attached. No joints or connectors will be provided to you. Hence make sure you bring extra joints and connectors (with stickers attached) as a backup.Construction of the top of the food tree should be strictly based upon the rules given in the rulebook. Also, make sure that hula hoops you have are clean and presentable.As instructed in rulebook, position of the base of the tree in finals need not be inside the cell. It can be anywhere.You will be instructed to submit the drone, hoops and Laptop before the final run. Then you will be given a CSV file and a Tree configuration Table (refer rulebook). This CSV file is just for your reference. The first column will be same but values in the second column can change. Third column is just for your understanding.In final arena setup, the base of the tree alongwith the height and sticker d will be fixed on the arena. On calling a team, teams will have to set up their hula hoops with the given orientation in the Tree configuration table.Teams will be allowed to change their csv file according to the given csv file in the presence of the instructor. No further changes to the code or csv file will be allowed. Then you will have to follow strictly the procedures mentioned in Theme Rules(6) in rulebook and @2384.
 
 
We hope that you will be considering the above parameters properly and make the code generic. Also one of the most important thing you need to consider is that the camera setup you have been working need not be same as that of finals in terms of lighting and height. So execute the theme in various light arrangements and heights (but within the constraints specified in rulebook). Firstly, concentrate more on reducing the collision chances so that you can avoid collision and reposition penalty and then only go for faster execution of your theme. Keep in mind that you have a bonus of 100 marks if you execute the theme without any collision which can play a major role to be the winner. Best of luck guys !!

I'm sure all of you have learnt valuable technical and non-technical skills during the course of this competition. Good luck to you in all of your future endeavors! The top-performing teams have been selected to compete in the finals at IIT-B. We address the following to these teams.• Now is the time to refine your solution, focus on speed, precision and repeatability. Go through the reposition rules in the Rulebook thoroughly, develop an optimal strategy for repositions in a run. You are allowed only two key inputs in order to re-arm the drone and have it continue its run, more than 2 key inputs will be considered as an additional reposition.• Focus on ease of emulation, develop an easy, straightforward and quick method to do so.• Focus on accurately and quickly mapping of WhyCon coordinates to your V-REP world as well, you already know the trends.Try changing the height of your overhead camera (within the range specified in the Rulebook) and check if your mapping function/algorithm performs equally well at the changed height.• We reiterate that the drone will start at a designated Start cell, it will go to the Home Tree first and then proceed as per the Food Configuration Table.• You will be give then final configuration table 5 minutes before the run and you are not allowed to change your code after you get the table. Hence, to ensure modularity, uniformity and ease in implementation, the food configuration table will be given in the form of the CSV file in the format of this file: ,HB_Food_Config_Table.csv. The file will also contain the number of non-food trees. Use have to use ONLY this file to configure your run. Reading from CSV files is pretty easy in Python, please follow this link to find out how to do so.Good luck to everyone once again!Regardse-Yantra Team#pin",3/8/19,hungry_bird

In our results the instructor has commented ""Good Job., However, you were supposed to traverse through Home tree before traversing through any food tree "".
 
The doubt is the rule that we must ""first traverse through Home tree before traversing through any food tree"" is not mentoned in the rule book, 
In the rulebook its only clearly mentioned that ""Bird can follow any order to collect food from food trees. But after traversing throughfood tree it must come back to home tree"", our interpretation of this is that the bird must traverse to the home tree each time only after collecting insects from food trees.

Thorough testing is the key to success here, and hence we strongly recommend you test your solution you developed with as many different tree configurations as possible. Keep in mind the task flow and all rules mentioned in the Rulebook while doing so.Just to re-iterate some points: • The drone will start at a designated Start cell, it will go to the Home Tree first and then proceed as per the Food Configuration Table.• One pass through the designated Food Tree indicates that it has picked up food, it has to drop food back at i.e. make one pass through the Home Tree before it can pick up more fruits.• Thus, after picking Food, it can cross through however many Food Trees(your path may be planned in that way), but they will not be considered if picked up Food has not been dropped at (i.e. drone has passed through) the Home Tree.• The drone fully crossing the plane of the Food Tree is considered as a pick-up.• Order of Food pickups does not matter. Develop an optimal solution.Focus on repeatability and precision in your solution. Focus on submitting your solution as early as possible to avoid last minute glitches, delays and inconveniences.

Your Progress Task has been evaluated and remarks have been given wherever required. As you may have noticed, there are no marks for your Progress Task. We intended to use the Progress Task to monitor your progress with the theme and provide you with required tips. Many of you have made amazing progress and a very little lot still has room for improvement. While this is great, it also means the competition to reach the finals has intensified. The final Task 4 will be launched soon. Please note, this task will have the highest weight-age. Your performance in this task can overshadow your performance in the previous tasks. Hence, put your best foot forward and get to the theme implementation. Read the rule book really well. Study the scoring formula given in the rule book and prepare your strategy to score maximum points. Further instructions will be given in Task 4 when launched.
 
With that been said, besides the personal tips given to each team wherever found necessary, we would like to add some more general tips here:
 
a) If a plant is damaged during the run and is not working, the team can call for a re-position as specified in the rule book. An identical plant can be used to replace the damaged plant. However, this will be at the cost of using one of the two re-positions that a team gets.
 
b) If a plant is damaged, regardless of how many times the bee tries to pollinate it, the LED cluster might not light up due to faulty circuit. Please take this into account when developing your code. As mentioned in tip a, you may use a re-position to replace the plant or you may program the bee to ignore the faulty plant. How you accomplish the latter, is up to you provided you follow the rules in the rule book and the bee flies autonomously.
 
c) When the LED cluster lights up, in some cases, the illumination may not be bright enough. In some other cases, the illumination could be intense such that only white light is detected. To this end, rather than focusing on detecting the LED cluster, see if you can design the plant in such a manner that your image processing algorithm detects the reflection of the light coming from the LEDs.
 
d) When designing the bee-stinger, ensure you do not obstruct the airflow of the motors. This could affect the manner in which your drone flies.
 
e) Regardless of how you design your plant or your beestinger, please follow the rules given in the rulebook strictly. Also, please remember, best plant and bee stinger design would get the most points. So keep aesthetics in mind and not just function.
 
f) Your final task and the finals at IIT Bombay, will have plants of different variations as specified in the rule book. Ensure your drone can pollinate all such plants.
 
So gear up and get on with the theme implementation. Task 4 will be released soon. You can use this thread to post any questions or queries you may have regarding the Theme. Take this opportunity to clear all your doubts, be it something generic or something technical.
 
Good luck!

While reading a file from SD card having FAT32 format, there is a limitation on the file name you use to read.
 
Ideally, the DIR_Name field in FAT directory is 11 bytes long which can hold the Short File Name (SFN) of the file you try to read (refer here). This also includes the period and a 3-byte file extension. So, the names of the files in the SD card shall fit to this syntax.
So, accordingly change the names of the .wav files of the Notes as follows (here we are providing few examples, apply the same to all files wherever applicable):
 
A5_Vio.wav

B3_Vio.wav

C3_Pia.wav

G#6_Pia.wav

E4_Tru.wav

E5_Tru.wav

C5_Flu.wav
 
 
For other files, the preceding Note names will change, the Instrument name in the filename should be as specified above.
 
Any audio wav file follows the WAVE file format which consists of information in its header part following which are the raw sound data samples to be played on to the speaker. Follow this link to find more about the WAVE file format. Accordingly, while reading such files, you will retrieve information from this header part and then read the data samples.

Upon further investigation we observed that the yaw values of the drone varied even when the orientation of the done was kept fixed on the surface of the ground and the drone was moved a few cm in either direction. More so we observed that not only is the value of yaw highly unstable but it varies with the presence of nearby magnetic fields (from wires, Laptop's Speakers etc.), and hence the reliability of the yaw sensor becomes highly questionable.
Ultimately, we burned the plutox.hex file on our drone and now it stopped giving us the yaw sensor value all together, Please suggest an effective alternative.

All of you are doing great. Don't get discouraged if you have not submitted Task 3. Progress Task and Task 4 have much higher weightage compared to Task 3 to get selected to the finals. However, you should submit Task 3 eventhough you score zero. Your Progress Task and Task 4 will not be evaluated unless you submit Task 3.

Now, you are left with two more tasks - Progress Task and Task 4. Task 4 will be the final task in which you will receive a configuration as mentioned in Rulebook. In Progress Task you will be given a task to traverse through a single hoop of a given configuration. 
 
Follow the guidelines to prepare for upcoming tasks :
Freeze (if you have not done already) the PID algorithm to hold the position of the drone. Refer to task 1.1 remarks you have received and the solution posted in piazza.Tune the PID properly either using the techniques you have learned in task 1.1 or any method you seem fit.
Before tuning make sure that you trim roll and pitch using the app if you find that even after publishing 1500 using ros command in roll and pitch direction, the drone moves drastically in any direction.Make sure your Kp is good enough that the drone responds to the command quickly.Make sure your Kd is good enough that the drone doesn't overshoot the setpoint much.Make sure your Ki is good enough that there is minimum steady state error.Tieing a thread under the chasis of the drone to move it manually would be very useful to validate your PID parameters
Once tuned validate the parameters by giving different waypoints for the drone to manuever.Emulate the drone in V-REP in real time as you have learned in Task 3 after emulating the hoops set in different direction (task 2)Manuever through hoops set in different orientations and positions.

This is to bring to your notice that if any of the Task is not submitted, your team will not be considered for the finals.
Those who have not submitted the Task yet, do submit it by Today.

For Task 2, If your code is not completely working, provide the incomplete solution and one text file explaining the reasons of not completing it and the number of solutions you tried.

For Task 3, complete the document and if your piano and mechanism is not completely working, make a video of task till whatever extent it is complete and also in video explain the reasons of the in-completion of Task.

This will help us to provide the guidelines to you to go forward with the theme implementation. No remarks or suggestions will be provided if you fail to submit the Task by Today.

Your actual journey begins with the implementation of the whole theme. Teams who have not submitted or couldn't do or have given up due to certain reasons, do NOT get disheartened.
You can still submit the task by incurring penalties according to the Grading Policy on the e-Yantra portal.
 
Moreover, please note that although all the Tasks hold much importance but the final video submission task is the one that will play the most important role in getting you to the finals at IIT Bombay.
 
TL;DR: Do NOT stop implementation and work hard!!

We are trying to tune it from last 5 days but getting no satisfactory results . We also tried to tune it on simulation first but it's no where near in real drone . Also the batteries are giving a flight time of just 3-4 minutes.so for 2 batteries we get about 8 minutes .and I took around  1.5 hour to charge those battery. So for tuning we have just 10 minutes of work time for 1.5 hours.we know that you have shipped batteries but we haven't got it yet.
 
So please increase the deadline of task 3 .as it's around 2 months for task 4 so we can compensate that in task 4 because if the PID parameters are tuned perfectly than the same can be used in task 4 and task 4 don't require this much of time.

As of you mentioned, detected note is to be striked on their respective onsets, we are trying our best to strike those notes on their onsets but some of those aren't being striked on their respective absolute onsets since it does take some delay to strike the keys.

For Task 3 of Hungry Bird, the initial position of the drone in WhyCon coordinates should be,[-5, 4, Z]Where,Z is whatever Z co-ordinate you are getting when the drone is placed on the ground.
 
The setpoint at which the drone should stabilize is at [0,0,20] in WhyCon frame of reference.
 
Rosbag submission instructions:

Add the rosbag record command in your launch file so that the Python script and the rosbag begin at the same time. Record your bag file for 60 seconds exactly. Your rosbag will be saved with a .bag extension. Add the following lines to your launch file to begin recording a rosbag: <node pkg=""rosbag"" type=""record"" name=""record""       args=""-O /<enter_desired_directory>/<filename>.bag whycon/poses --duration=60s"" output=""screen""/>While recording rosbag, exactly 30 seconds after the beginning of the flight irrespective of whether it has stabilized at the destined setpoint you should compulsorily push your drone to new position [2,-2,23] in whycon frame of reference.You can tie a small string underneath the frame to easily pull the drone to the desired position. 

Video Submission Instructions:

Your submission video should be a screen-capture of your screen containing the WhyCon image_out along with your emulation happening in real time in V-REP. You should record your submission video at the same time as you are recording rosbag file. Ideally the rosbag file would correspond exactly similar to your video.
 
You should strictly follow the above rules. Submissions not following the rules will not be evaluated.

Make changes to the emulation_vrep.launch and launch the file. Make sure you run the nodes: usb_cam, whycon, aruco_marker_publisher, plutonode, drone_server, key_command in the launch file. Also the node image_proc should be run under the group ""usb_cam"" as already given in emulation_vrep.launchComplete the child script of emulation_script dummy. The script should ideally emulate the position and orientation of the Food trees and Non-food trees.The hoops have the dummy Position_hoop(number) which can be used to set the position of the hoop and have the dummy Orientation_hoop(number) to set the orientation of the hoop.You can choose the order in which you emulate. Either you can emulate the orientation of the hoops first followed by the position or vice-versa. You are also given the choice to use either one whycon marker or aruco marker at a time or multiple markers to emulate the trees. There is no compulsion that both whycon and ArUco marker should be placed at the same time to emulate a tree at once. You can first set the position of tree using whycon marker and then remove it and place arUco marker and set its orientation or vice versa. You can use the /input_key topic to do so. You are free to add any number of inputs in the node. Instructions in how to add the inputs are given in the tutorials.pdf. For instance, initially all the position of the trees are being emulated in vrep based on the whycon detection. if you say on pressing 1, you can fix the position of all the tree or any tree you want to. or say if you feel like the setting is not right then pressing 2 can reset it and again start emulating. similarly for orientation as well. You are also free to use any arUco id. For eg: There is no compulsion that arUco_id 0 should correspond to Sal tree.To ensure that you have correctly emulated the position and orientation, compare the overhead camera output and the V-REP scene from above.You should take screenshot in such a way that the image should have output of overhead camera and top view of vrep. This is very important. Please follow instruction in @1538 to take the screenshot.

We have received queries on Piazza  and on the Helpdesk regarding flex sheets and thermocol sheets being prohibited in some regions.

Regarding flex sheet printing, we would like you to find similar alternatives by inquiring with vendors.
 
NOTE that CLOTH printing is NOT allowed. you may print the arena on any other material that resembles texture/suface of a flex sheet without changing the dimensions provided.
Please note that in the finals, we will be using flex sheets. You must print on flex sheets if the option is available to you.
If your theme incorporates thermocol sheets or blocks in it, you may choose to use alternative materials such as cardboard, sunboard, plywood, MDF etc. IF thermocol is prohibited in your region.

Congratulations to those who have submitted Task 1.1 and Task 1.2. Result will be announced soon. Meanwhile, if you feel like you have performed pretty good in Task 1 and you have the confidence that you will be selected for Stage 2, you need to work on certain concepts as listed below:
 
Strengthen your concepts in PID. Try to improve your PID controller and test it in on V-REP. Because, when it comes to the real drone, it is far more tough to hold its position at the setpoint. So if your controller itself is wrong, you may not be able to figure out if it is the error in tuning parameters or the controller itself. So go through as much as tutorials you can find and make the controller full proof.Also understand the nature of the change in characteristics at different pid parameters. Understand it and learn how efficiently you can tune the pid parameters.In upcoming tasks, you need not fix the controller to just PID algorithm. You are free to use other controllers as well. But before freezing the controller, make it full proof using V-REP.Also look into different methods by which you can increase the accuracy of transformation from real world to whycon world. Experiment and find a better solution.
 
I hope you had learned important skills from the tasks and more importantly had great fun while doing tasks. All the best !!

Those who have missed the Task 1.1 deadline can still submit it along with Task 1.2 as specified in Submission_Instruction.pdf and post @892. Those who have already submitted can improve the code for accuracy and re-submit it. 
 
Warning: As mentioned before, your submission will be automatically evaluated. If you do not follow the below guidelines and instructions your submission will not be taken into consideration. No queries on result will be entertained.
 
Note: Task 1.1 is automatically evaluated against test audio files with sharp notes, all octave notes, stereo notes, notes of different instruments like violin, trumpet, piano, cello, clarinet, sax-soprano and flute. 
 
Common errors found after auto-evaluation of Task 1.1 submission:
 
The note_detect function is not returning the argument in specified format. The output format must be string having the detected note only. For example, if given note is A4, function should return ""A4"" and not [A4], ""['A4']"" or frequency. Do not use append function in note_detect.Different conventions are used for sharp notes. Follow this one, for example if the given note is A#4, then note_detect function should return ""A#4"" and not ""A-4"", ""A4#"", ""A-Sharp4"", ""A#4/Bb4"", ""Bb4"", ""A#4 or Bb4"".Code is not optimized for different test cases. There are 9 octaves and 12 (including sharp/base) notes in each octave. We found that many teams have not considered all the 108 notes. So you should have mapping of all the frequencies and their notes.Function is not returning anything if the specified conditions are not met. By default the note_detect function should return an empty string "" "" even if your function is unable to detect any note. For example, many teams have used return keyword inside if conditions only. Due to which if any of the conditions are not met, the function is not returning anything since code is not able to come out of the function. Some have also used infinite while loop without any break condition.
 
While resubmitting Task 1.1 make sure that code does not contain any of these errors.
These instructions are also applicable for Task 1.2A and Task 1.2B.

josbriz7pkj2gb,Pinned,      [Pollinator Bee] Regarding WhyCon marker overlapping the color patches,"Dear Students,
 
A lot of you are getting stuck with respect to the whycon coordinates overlapping the patch and thus making it difficult for you to detect the patch. Your image processing code is running within the subscriber function of the topic whycon/image_out (if you are following the provided snippet). Thus, you should be still able to detect the patches when the drone is flying around. You don't have to detect the patches only after or before the drone lands or takes off respectively. Anyway, if you still cannot manage to detect the patches while the drone is flying around and to make it simpler for those facing this problem, you are free to subscribe to visionSensor/image_rect. This way the frame upon which you will be running your image processing code will be free of whycon marker and its coordinates.

joibrjtno2d4io,Pinned,      [Pollinator Bee] The road so far and Task 1.2,"Dear Students,
 
The penalty for uploading Task 1.1 has been reduced. Detailed information regarding this is mentioned at @884. We hope you take complete advantage of this and upload your work if you haven't already. If you have uploaded your work and you think you can do better, we encourage you to weigh the penalties and how much you think you stand to score and upload again if you have a better solution.
 
Either way, if you are feeling disheartened over your performance in Task 1.1, you should know the competition is not over yet. You still have a chance to make a huge dent in your score as Task 1.2 has more weightage than Task 1.1. You have two weeks to complete and upload Task 1.2 (deadline being 28th November). So don't waste any time and get on the job. Best teams with amazing scores in Task 0 and Task 1 will receive hardware drones from us to work on for the remaining Tasks of the competitions.
 
Before you begin, let us reflect and take stock of what we have learnt so far.
 
In Task 0, we learnt that ROS is a middle-ware that comes in between your logic and the hardware robot which makes it a very versatile tool for developers. We learnt how to create a workspace and how to create a package. Then we saw what a topic is and how do we create a publisher and a subscriber topic to pass data between nodes. Finally we saw how to use a launch file and launch multiple nodes at the same time.
 
Following which, we headed into Task 1.1. In this task we learnt about the PID control algorithm. While studying PID, we saw that it is made of 3 components called Proportional (P), Integral (I) and Derivative (D). Each of these components are calculated based on equations and the error value. This error value is the difference between the desired point and the current point. After calculating each of these components we saw how by multiplying the components by a factor or constant, the behavior of the body changes. This is what we called tuning and the constants (factors) were Kp, Ki and Kd. The handy pid_tune_gui node allowed us to change these factors at runtime itself. One thing to note however, is that there is no exact science to tuning. The constants that would work for me, may or may not work for you.
 
We also learnt about the drone and the various degrees of freedom (DoF) within it. For example - Roll, Pitch, Yaw and Altitude (or Throttle). We saw the pluto drone package and its message type. We calculated the PID across these DoFs and applied a correction value to them using the Pluto Message type. Most of us were successful in holding the drone at the desired location as given in the problem statement.
 
Through the given boilerplate code, we learnt how to subscribe and get the whycon poses. We also learnt how to subscribe and get the values set by the pid_tune_gui node.
 
Now we head into Task 1.2. Holding higher weightage than Task 0 and Task 1.1, this task gives an opportunity to you to score as much marks as you can and give you a fighting chance to head into stage 2 of this competition. Task 1.2 builds on everything you have learnt so far and some more. As per the provided Problem statement, your job is to write a node that will allow the drone to visit waypoints as specified in the pdf file. This will build upon your knowledge of PID. You also have to detect the colors placed in the simulation using image processing and publish the same. You have a good 2 weeks to accomplish so do not wait until the end moment to implement this task. Start off ASAP and get going.
 
Good Luck

Some of you have received a 'getObjectPosition' error when running the V-REP simulation as pointed out in @481, @482 and @493. Unfortunately we have not been able to recreate the error and cannot ascertain the exact bug. We are however confident that the error is occurring because catkin_make is not compiling the pluto_drone package correctly for V-REP. In the above mentioned posts, students have succeeded in solving this issue by deleting build and devel folders and running catkin_make again or simply migrating to a new system. While we try to fix this, if you come across this error, try to delete build and devel folders and run catkin_make again. If that doesn't help out either, we highly recommend you migrate to a new system and implement the task rather than wasting time.

Dear Participants,
 
1. Before posting any query, kindly search whether the same has already been posted or not. As instructors, we try to provide solutions as soon as you post the queries and we would be grateful if you take few seconds and search the queries.
 
2. We really appreciate when teams help other teams by posting but before posting any answer or ""solution"" kindly ask yourself, Should I be telling this to my competitor?
If the answer is No, then please don't post it as ultimately only a handful of teams would be coming to the finals at IIT Bombay. Make sure you don't do anything to jeopardize that.
Again, we want that you guys help each other as that is the whole essence of this competition but don't outright post solutions.
 
3. Whenever you are posting, kindly write your Team ID and then your problem statement crisp and clear.
 
4. Do NOT post as anonymous; Do NOT call us for Theme related queries as this whole discussion forum is dedicated for this purpose only.
 
5. We also insist all the participants who feel awkward to ask any query here, can still follow the posts which have Instructor's endorsed answers or the questions which Instructor's think are good one.

jo7h5rlxqd36me,Pinned,      How to read ROS message,"Look at the example of how to read message type :
geometry_msgs/Pose
In terminal when you type 
rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Pose
you get the following output,
geometry_msgs/Point position
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
  float64 w
Look the way the message is intended. This indicates x,y,z comes under the message type geometry_msgs/Point position and x,y,z,w comes under the message type geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation. 
If you still have doubt, type the following command in your terminal:
rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Point
Then you will see the following output :
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
So for instance, if you are creating a subscribing node which is subscribing to a topic say ""/test_message"" and the topic is of type "" geometry_msgs/Point "". So i would be writing a subscriber like 
from geometry_msgs.msg import Point
rospy.Subscriber('/test_message',Point,self.callback)

def callback(msg):
	print ""x"",msg.x
	print ""y"",msg.y # This prints y of the incoming message
So instead if the topic was of type ""geometry_msgs/Pose"", then the new subscriber will look like
from geometry_msgs.msg import Pose
rospy.Subscriber('/test_message',Pose,self.callback)

def callback(msg):
	print ""x"",msg.position.x
	print ""y"",msg.quaternion.y # This prints y of the quaternion of the incoming message
Similarly, look how /whycon/poses and /aruco_marker_publisher/markers are structured. Indendation will help you understand the message properly.

jruc0hjpro4bc,Week 2/3 - 2/9,      Drone behaviour Anomaly,"Even though the drone is not stabilising, we have successfully completed task 3. When we are providing a particular co-ordinate for the drone to stabilise at, it is hovering around the said point within a certain error margin (moving to and fro), therefore not standing still.But the problem is being amplified while following a path, since a path comprises 20 odd intermediate points, therefore we have to define a certain error margin. Due to the erratic behaviour, if the defined error is too small the drone is not being able to progress, if too large then subsequent points are automatically regarded as 'reached'.
Along with the faulty hardware of the drone, none of the batteries are behaving consistently, in the sense that each require distinct tuning parameters(particularly for height and yaw) for stabilising.

jrnr750r98f446,Week 1/27 - 2/2,      Drone trying to override commands given,"Respected Sir and fellow Students,
After lot of failed attempts in trying to tune PID enough for Path Traversal, we noticed that drone tries to set its values automatically. For example, if the code instructs the drone to go left, it will seem that our code and drone's internal code are fighting to go in opposite directions.
Easy steps to reproduce/experience this behavior:
1.Connect your drone to your laptop/PC
2. Launch drone_comb.launch
3. Try to tilt drone and change its vertical acceleration
 
After doing the above one may experience unexpected and weird behavior from the drone. Moreover, the same unexpected behavior is experienced when running the external code.
Also, one more increasingly frustrating aspect of this unexpected behavior is fluctuation of sensor values (Till task 3, we thought we could resolve it). As soon as the drone is armed, there is a huge deviation in magnetometer values which increases with increase in throttle (Eg Yaw when disarmed is 85, when armed 72, when throttle is increased 35, all for the same orientation of the drone [infact: the drone is stationary]). Moreover, the accelerometer and gyroscope show heavy fluctuation (+- 50) when armed and throttle is increased. All this makes it impossible to set drone yaw and detect battery level to compensate for cutin values gradually as battery decreases.
 
Is this behavior normal? Is anyone else experiencing it?
I would be grateful for instructors' reply in this regard.
Thanking You

1. We completed task 3 and the drone was holding its position at the set-point. The altitude was varying (+/- 5 error) after remaining stable at the set-point for 3-4 seconds. The other axes also had +/- 5 error at max. We are using 0.030s as sample time.
 
2. We simulated the progress task on VREP using only one hoop to verify the working of our code. The simulated drone followed the path correctly, went through the hoop, avoided all obstacles and landed back at the start point. From this we concluded that our code was working fine.
 
3. We tried running the same lua code and python script for path planning (with PID values changed adopted task 3), but the drone did not hold its position at the initial way point (we chose it arbitrarily) most of the times. We re-tuned the parameters from scratch but when we change batteries, the drone was completely out of tune. Sometimes, when the drone held its position, the path was computed. The drone flew in the right direction but it flew too fast & away from the vision sensor's range when the way points were computed.
 
4. We emulated the hoops correctly. To check if the path planning was working correctly, we manually moved the drone to the initial waypoint, and all the paths were computed correctly.
 
5. Our batteries are discharging very quickly and we are not getting more than 3 minutes of flight time. Initially, on the app it shows 4.1V when fully charged. However, on taking off it drops down to 3.4V. The altitude also varies because the voltage of the batteries is not stable. We checked this with the App. Drona aviation suggested that we change the propellers. We bought new propellers and changed it. No improvement.
 
At this point, we feel we've tried everything we can think of. I feel the batteries are the problem because as the batteries are used up more, the results are more erratic.

What should we do just a few days are left to complete the task? ",1/23/19,"hungry_bird,pollinator_bee"

We are facing problem with the new batteries. We connected the fully charged battery to the drone, caliberated it and then tried to take off the drone using the pluto controller app. when connected initially, the battery indicator shows 2-3 lines but when in flight it shows to 1 line or low battery. When landed, the indicator again shows 2 lines.
We are having this problem with 3 out of 4 batteries.
But the drone is unable to take off even when throttle is provided using the app.
This is causing problems during testing our codes.
 
Please help
