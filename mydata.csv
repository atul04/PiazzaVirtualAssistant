jqomuljtkgo2rk,Week 1/6 - 1/12,      Query regarding line following,"Hi all.
Team ID #108.
 
I have a query regarding line sensor.
The gap between the left IR sensor and the right IR sensor is little more than 3cm. 
1) While line following, if the bot deviates from the line, we will not know in which direction it had turned until and unless one of the left/right sensor reads black as the gap between the sensors is little big. As in, let us say the middle IR goes just off the line. At this instant the readings will be all white as the gap between the middle and right/left is more than line thickness. So until the extreme ends IR sensors reads black, we cannot determine the direction in which it has deviated. So even if we correct the position, the movement of the bot looks somewhat zigzag like thing.
2) As mentioned earlier, the gap between left and right IR sensors is little more than 3cm, we cannot detect nodes like the one before the TDZ. 
 
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

This is Nishanth from team ant bot #108.
 
We received the kit recently, and there is a Li-ion battery that we have to use throughout the competition.
 
We want to know how long we need to charge the Li-ion batteries as overcharging them may cause the battery to burn/ blast, and over discharging it may cause it to not function properly, which we certainly dont want to happen. Also, what is the voltage beyond which it shouldnt be used / shouldnt be discharged?
 
Please specify the upper voltage i.e upto what voltage it has to be charged for full capacity and the lower voltage i.e beyond which it shouldnt be discharged, so that we can atlease check using a multimeter.
 
The charger you have provided doesnt have any light indication from which we can get to know if it is fully charged or not. Last time you had provided a manual for the battery is what i have heard of, from my friends. I feel you should have provided a manual for this too, as charging Li-ion batteries without knowledge/ caution can cause serious explosive/risky situations for beginners like us.

As far as testing the code against undisclosed test-cases goes, how would I know which objects are to be detected and which dictionary is to be used to label the ArUco marker in those test-cases?
 
(1) Does the user give input through the console? If yes, then what will the input format be?

jofg4qrwae31pj,Week 11/11 - 11/17,      Clarity regarding aruco detection in task 1.2 of ant bot,"Hi all.
 
In task1.2.pdf that was provided in the ""Task description"" folder for ant bot, i had a query regarding the aruco marker detection.
In page 2, under the ""Problem description"" heading, there is a sentence that reads out as follows:
 
""The team is expected to detect the ID and angle of the ArUco marker using these designatedBit size and combination dictionaries of the ArUco marker.""
 
What do you mean by the angle of Aruco marker!?
 
In the sample output.jpg that is given on page 4 of the same document, the aruco marker has the following information printed in blue text. Here it is.
 

What do they mean!!? The other images have a tuple of points which i have understood as the centroid of the image. But in this case, it is highly confusing. Is this related to angle of aruco marker of some sort that my puny brain isnt able to understand?
 
In the instructions it is told that we have to import the x,y coordinates from the color_detect() function to a .csv file.
Should we also print it on the image like the way you have told in sample_ouptut.jpg in the same document, or just identifying the aruco ID && drawing a 25 pixel border around the image suffices?
 
Thank you.",11/13/18,ant_bot
