Launch_A_Module	"  Dear Finalists,   Here are few suggestions which you can choose to follow for your theme:  Teams may have to use re-position/restart in case your bot goes haywire, so your code should be ready to handle re-position/restart. Study about the rules regarding these carefully.  Always have the battery sufficiently charged for the final demonstration, or keep extra battery if you have. Remember e-Yantra won't provide you another battery. Each team will be provided with a laptop to run the code for the practice session. Laptops will have both linux and windows installed. You may have to install your respective libraries to run your code.One practice arena is provided amongst 5 teams. We are opening up practice room early for LM and expect teams to understand importance of time and help each other. Your focus should be to calibrate your code for given light condition.We will provide you objects and obstacle blocks, however you can carry few on your own in case you need it. #pin"

Thanks_To_Eyantra	"Team ID - 5093 Qualified - Stage-1     Being a part of eyantra was a wonderful experience . We are first year students , thus were quite nervous in the beginning of the competition but just after task - 1 we realised that it was so well organised that a person having patience can perform his/her best . I personally liked the idea of providing study material regarding each and every task . This was the best part of eyantra as it brings every participant at equal stage. I really liked this competition and hope that next time will make it to IIT Bombay . Being new to micro controller and its interfacing with blender we faced many challenges , in fact this was the most difficult part for us. We request the eyantra team to provide a detailed tutorial on xbee communication with blender so that we can use this concept to link blender with any other micro controller , this could also help us in building interesting and useful projects. Again thanks a lot to the eyantra team for guiding us throughout the competition .            "

CCFinals	" Dear Finalists,   Here are few suggestions which you can choose to follow for your theme: If you are not using perspective transformation then it will be difficult for you to calibrate your robot based upon the arena we will provide to you practice session.  Teams may have to use re-position/restart in case your bot goes haywire, so your code should be ready to handle re-position/restart. Study about the rules regarding these carefully.  Teams are not required to display numbers on LCD, just display on the python console.  Always have the battery sufficiently charged for the final demonstration, or keep extra battery if you have. Remember e-Yantra won't provide you another battery.  Team can use the algorithm described here (click here) for full-proof number detection.  Each team will be provided with a laptop to run the code for the practice session. Laptops will have both linux and windows installed. You may have to install your respective libraries to run your code.  "

The left motor is slow with respect to the right motor due to which our bot is too much deviating from its path and thus increasing the average time to cover the arena. We had shown the movement of the bot in our progress video and raised the question there too. Please help us with this.  "
XBEE Bi-Direction Data Transmission.	"Using PySerial, I'm able to serially send 1 byte commands to the bot.   Whats working: Lets say I send 1 (0X01) from PC to bot. I've hard coded the bot to move forward if it receives 1 (0X01).   data = UDR0 if (data == 0X01) {   forward(); }   What doesn't work: When I try to apply the same technique to read some sensor data from bot and send to PC. Nothing seems to work.   //bot side if (data == 0x01) {    URD0 = IR0  }   //PC side in python ser.write('\x01') val = ser.readline() # val = ser.readline().decode('ascii') //this outputs blank too. printf(val) I just get blank output. Am I doing something wrong on the python side?      "
Task 5 Evaluation	"Sir,  What will be the final evaluation criteria for task 5? Points or time. If i'm completing task in less time with less points and more time(less than 600 sec) and more points then which is more beneficial."
Doubts regarding final arena.	"Sir, We would like to clarify very clearly regarding final arena that will be competed on in the finals.1) Will there be any changes in the arena in cross a crater other than the number and placement of cavities and obstacles?

Communication on traversal	"Dear Sir/Maam,A very commonly faced problem in the Blender Game Engine is the delay in receiving serial data. This delay is causing the detected objects, shapes and obstacles to spawn at wrong places on the game engine, more than a few times. Due to the same reasons, the paths that appear as the robot traverses the plane on the game engine are also not correctly aligned.We found that the best solution to this problem would be to send the serial data collectively in the end once the Firebird robot traverses the complete arena. However, were in doubt since were not sure if it is important to depict the real time motion of the robot on the game engine."

Below are some tips, we consider can help you. Note that these are generic, we are not directed to on any single teams.    Please know that the dimensions of base-station and rover is fixed. Some of you have made the base station taller than the specified height.This is subject to disqualification.Map has  black markers(checkpoints) to specify the position of checkpoints on the arena.RGB led on the Rover and Base Station should be lit(refer rule-book).Passing an array/list from laptop to the Base station for spotter to move, should be think properly. How to correlate the movement of servos according to the processed MAP?There is a difference in theoretical and practical implementation.Please find that is it practically possible to achieve 0-180 degree in a servo?Ready made gripper is not allowed (already specified in rule book).Don't just do stuff, know why and how are you doing it. Learn the technology behind how things work. For example, what is WIFI  (you can google it to find the answer, or if you have doubt post on piazza), similarly what is DC and servo motor.How node_MCU can be utilized efficiently?Do not assume things, If you have doubt, ask about it on Piazza. We will try to resolve it to best possible extent.Follow coding standards. You will be asked to submit your code for final implementation.Some teams have copied texts from rule-book and Task descriptions, we know about it and for now we have let it go by deducting some marks in Task-4. Please do not fool around, we have enough experience and expertise to find such things. We have disqualified 2 such teams in Stage-1 for copying code and we can do so, if required in Stage-2. Be honest and work hard.   Whatever be your marks in Task-4, you must think about final Task-5 (video submission). Task-5 has the higher weight-age.

Raspberry Pi Wifi adapter not blinking.	"Respected Sir / Ma'am,   The  Raspberry Pi initially given to us stopped working because of board failure. We are currently working on  Raspberry Pi 1 model B instead of B+ . The Wifi adapter does not blink when connected to the Pi , powered through the power bank (2.1 A , 5V ). Also tried the following: 1] Connected the Pi to the router using an ethernet cable in order to ssh into it . Also powered the Pi (2.1 A ,5V) using the power bank . But the ethernet cable itself does not blink . 2] Connected the Pi to the  TV using the HDMI cable . Powered it to 2.1 A, 5 V through the power bank. No startup logs were displayed . All that appeared on the TV screen was a coloured  image (picture has been attached with the query  ). 3]  I  have rewritten the OS , numerous times onto the SD card in order to make  1] and 2] work.

Launch_A_Module	"  Task-4 results for LM is out and available on portal. This post is meant to give some help tips to assist you come up with better solution.   On evaluation of Task-4 submitted by teams, we found some common mistakes/misconception with teams. Below are some tips, we consider can help you. Note that these are generic, we are not directed to on any single teams.      For a colour-marker in door area, there can be multiple matching objects in working area but only one object need to deposited in door area. Other Object(s) will act as an Obstacle.( with reference to Q7 of Task-4)Some teams have not followed the arena configuration for Task-4. For video submission (Task-5) ensure that arena is setup as per given configuration. For wrong arena setup, score will be evaluated to zero.Ready made gripper is not allowed (already specified in rule book)Some teams are using 3-servo motors for pick-placer mechanism. Think whether it is required. Some suggested mechanism can be done with just two. For example gripping part can be done with one. More servos means more power consumption. Think about you mechanism. Note: This is just a suggestion and not mandate, do whatever is good and possible for you.Don't just do stuff, know why and how are you doing it. Learn the technology behind how things work. For example, what is Xbee and Zigbee (you can google it to find the answer, or if you have doubt post on piazza), similarly what is DC and servo motor, difference between sharp sensors and proximity sensors, how these works. Some of you have mentioned using robot body (green color and circular shape) for position and orientation detection. It is difficult because color on robot surface is not uniform. We are not discouraging you to do this, but make sure you try it immediately and improvise on idea if required. We suggest that for robot position and orientation detection, you can make use of Sharp and/or proximity sensors already present on the robot as well the overhead camera. This would help you get a more accurate estimate and this in turn would ensure you run into fewer problems due to incorrect detection.Do not assume things, If you have doubt, ask about it on Piazza. We will try to resolve it to best possible extent.Follow coding standards.

Line in cross a crater	Can we skip the lines move straight to boulder picking diagonally and then straight to crator region?  No black line following? Is this allowed? 
Servo motors (360 degree)	We have used two 180 degree servo motors in our spotter but the algorithm gets quite complicated.   It would be much easier if we were allowed to use one 360 degree and one 180 degree servo instead.   Is that okay?   Team #1340
stg2_Cross_a_Crater	"Dear Participants,   Task 4 results have been released, please check the same on the portal. Pay attention to the comments and feedback provided.   A few general instructions for theme implementation:    1. In few image submissions we have found that the black rectangle of the Arena is not fully visible. In such case web-camera should be manually rotated to change from portrait to landscape mode.   2. You can use template matching/contour detection for determining Cavities and Obstacles in the arena.   3. Cavities should be circular.   4. Only one sharp sensor is allowed(provided in the kit). No other sensors apart from the one provided in the kit/Firebird V are allowed.   5. Usage of too many actuators simultaneously may lead to rapid current surge.   6. IR proximity sensor might not be suitable to detect Obstacles due to varying heights.   7. Use concepts of capturing Region of Interest and Perspective transformation to capture the region inside the black rectangle.   8. Check the resource on portal, Image Processing guide has been updated.    Be ready for Progress Video submissions, all the best!!  "

Burning the AVR Bootloader Microcontroller firmware-reg	"**we can program our bot using two methods-                      1.By using  AVR BOOTLOADER GUI                       2.By using NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2 ** In first method you can program the bot by using only the USB cable, no other ISP programmer is needed and It is strongly recommended that you only use this Bootloader method for programming robot  **But if you use ""NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2"" programmer with the robot then boot section code might get erased and robot will no longer support boot loading. If you again wish to program the bot using AVR BOOTLOADER GUI you can follow this steps to burn again the bootloader    STEP 1-Download this bootloader file M256014_7456MHz._USBUART_2.a90. and save it on you desktop. **Note:Following steps are the same procedure that you follow while you use ""NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2"" programmer to program the bot** STEP 2-plug the NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2 to your PC and then connect it to your robot and switch it ON **In step 3 im assuming that you have already installed the avrdude if not please install it and continue** STEP 3-Open the cmd and type the following command without the mentioned single quotes and press enter:- 'avrdude -c stk500v2 -p m2560 -P NEX-USB-ISP -U flash:w:""C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\M2560-14_7456MHz. USB-UART 2.a90"":i' ----It will take 5-6 minutes for avrdude to write and verify the bootloader in the configurable boot memory section of the micro controller. After writing is finished you can remove the NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2 from your bot and switch off the bot  ----Now you can follow the same steps provided in the manual for programming the bot using the AVR BOOTLOADER GUI.   ***FINAL NOTE- HAVE PROPER PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN BOOT LOADER OPERATING PRINCIPLE, PROGRAMMING USING NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2.

Task 3.3	For task 3.3 - Should we start the robot from start position? How far should we make the robot move front and back?How long should the video be and what all should we show in the video? Do we have to make an exact urdf model of the robot we have constructed or is it fine if it is an approximate model?Due to a problem with one of our motors we are having a problem setting the speed perfectly. Because of this the bot tends to move slightly slant. Will that be fine? It would be really helpful if we could see a sample video of at least the screen recording of Rviz for this task.      #pin
Tips for construction of Balance Bot and Atmel Studio(With Arduino library) example	"Tips for construction Good construction will not only make coding easy but also make your robot robust and will be able to perform tasks easily. Loose cables are the source of failure so fix the cables tightly using cable ties and don't let them hang outside the robot body.While testing Balance Bot it will fall many times, so make structure for protection.(You can use sponge, studs at top of bot)Due to vibration and fall components will pop out, so use screws and cable-ties to hold the components. Atmel Studio example project(with Arduino library) In Task 3 - scheduling sub-task, lots of people are facing problem of integrating 'Arduino library' and 'scilab library'. Another problem is using Arduino library(serial, delay, millis)  with  different clock Frequency.Find the Atmel Studio project(with Arduino library and modified libraries) balance_bot_control.zip here. Use this project for your further task. Clock setting is also changed to 14745600 Hz.   Finally, we are giving chance to submit Task 3-scheduling sub-task (video and code) using above code till final date of submission of Task3(i.e. 17th January). But instead of the grading policy there will be penalty of 40%  and hard deadline of 17th January. So after this submission marks will be Zero. Apart from that, submission for all tasks are open till the end of Task 4 and it is recommended to submit tasks completed by you. These submission will be evaluated separately and will be considered for certificates and also in later stage.   But ponder on these questions while doing future tasks:   What do you think is the importance of sensing task for making balance bot?? Why there is need for visualizing this data(in Scilab or Arduino)?? How will you use it to debug the robot?? Why there is need for plotting pwm vs speed plot??(You can post your answers in follow up discussion)   With regards, e-Yantra Team.   #pin"

Time duration	1. What will be the duration between when we are given with all the inputs like map and SOI  list and we go for the run?    2. How much time will be given to recalibrate after the first run? 
Power Bank to power Rpi	"Hi Everyone, we are team no. EB3848 So we called the e-Yantra team about our issue to power the Rpi using a power bank as it is a risk to use the circuit.  After some convincing they allowed it on ONE condition, that no other team objects to using a power bank. Usually no one recommends using the GPIO pins to power, as its always a danger of burning the pi. Hence I ask all other finalist in the EB theme, if you're fine with it. If anyone objects we will NOT use it. Though I suggest all of us use a power bank as its much safer.   Thank You."
Queries about final demonstration	"I had some queries about final demonstration: 1)Can we use a power bank to power our Rpi because using the circuit to power Rpi is a risk. 2)If we just change the position of our camera, will it be fine?  "

Task-5 Updated Scores and Graph	"Dear all,   There was a slight mistake on the portal side where the bonus marks were not divided by three. Hence, such large numbers in scores.   Now, the issue had been sorted out. Check the updated scores and graph.   Sorry for the inconvenience.   Thanks."
About EB Task 5 Result and Graph	"Now that the graph has been released, it says 4 teams have scored between 3001 and 4000 and 1 team between 4001 and 5000.But I am wondering how that is even possible, Correct me if I am wrong but the formula for task 5 marks isTotal Marks = Orignal Conf marks + (bonus conf marks / 3 )and the grading formula is:(600 - T) + (VS * 150) + (CC * 100) - P + B If total number of blocks are 6 (original conf), then in an ideal scenario, consider: T = 0VS = 6CC = 6P = 0B = 80   Then according to the above formula, Score = (600 - 0) + 6*150 + 6*100 - 0 + 80 = 2180     For Bonus conf, (ideal scenario) T = 0VS = 5CC = 5P = 0B = 80 Score = (600 - 0) + 5*150 + 5*100 - 0 + 80 = 1930 Score / 3 = 643      For, code (ideal scenario) Score = 50     Therefore in an ideal scenario Task 5 Score = 2180 + 643 + 50 = 2873    Since we do not live in an ideal world, it is unlikely any bot completed task in 0 seconds, Can you please explain how 5 teams got these seemingly impossible marks. Thank you.      "

It would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you.   "
How to change the position axis of rotation	"Sir, the robot rotates on its axis which is the centre of the robot(base plate) in Rviz. But the actual robot rotates on the axis that is situated in the middle of the wheels, which is not the centre of the robot(as the wheels are at the back).So during rotation the centre of the rviz robot is in the same position, but the actual robot centre has rotated in a circle of radius equal to half of the base plate width. So is there any way we can change the position of axis of rotation of the robot in Rviz?"
final buzzer	Is it any problem if we have not beeped the final buzzer of 5 sec? will we get any penalty. We have just beeped for 1sec at the landing zone at 9min 30 sec.

Arena Map	"Dear Instructors, In the provided map, obstacles and boundaries are equally dark, but if the bot has to choose between running over an obstacle or crossing one of the boundaries, I would rather have it cross the boundary as collision with obstacle displaces the obstacle and hence the static map would cease to be an accurate portrayal of the actual arena.   I request you to allow us to color the boundaries grey (we will choose a shade that is darker than the padding but lighter than blocks). That way, even if later on we want to treat blocks and boundaries as equally lethal we will simply decrease the value of occupied_thresh. "

Regarding task 5 launch	"Sir,we are having our college exams from 27th Feb to 3rd March and it will be very difficult for us to complete the task and work for the progress of the task during this period. We kindly request you to please extend the launch date to the next week. Time is very crucial for us to complete this task and we would be very thankful if you could consider our request.   "
Unable to balance the robot on slope	"Sir, we are facing little difficulty in making the robot traverse on the slope, i.e., the bridge on the arena. Initially it faces difficulty to climb as it approaches the slope, as the speed is low. If more speed is given, it does climb halfway through, but on the downward journey it's unable to balance and accelerates (even if speed is set 0) and falls. On the other hand it can't static balance on the slope at all and is very unstable.   The questions being, is the cascaded PID algorithm sufficient to balance/traverse it on a slope as well? If possible please provide some hints/tips. Thanks!"
Loose motor	"Initially both the motors was firm and we could hardly rotate with our hand. But now one of the motor has become very loose. We can easily rotate with our hand. This motor takes 1-2 seconds to come to stop from full RPM, whereas another motor takes just a fraction of second to stop.   Is there any way to make this motor tight again?   Thanks, eYRC-BB#669"

Motor gets Slow;	"  We are facing an issue with one of our motors. The L298 Module Heat Sink gets hot and one motor rotates too slow while the other rotates normally. And everytime the same motor rotates slow, and the wire to that motor heats up. What should we do to get solve this ? Please help.  "
Regarding joystick power	"You have recommended to use 2 AA battery for using xbee and joystick. But You have also mentioned that xbee requires 3.3V . So how can 2 AA batteries give 3.3v? Also, if we want to use any other battery like LiPo then how can we use it as it has 12V output?"
Still ignoring obstacles	"Sir, we tried all the instructions and studied the parameters of the params file. We tried changing the pdist and gdist and other parameters also, but the robot still goes over the obstacles. Kindly guide us."
Few queries about the Maneuvers	"1. For Maneuver 1, does the robot have to move only on the white path PT1/PT2 or just crossing RD1 and RD2 anyhow is sufficient?   2. Similarly, for completing M2, robot slightly moves out of the white path sometimes and the turns near the hills are very tight are the path is very close to the walls. is it ok if the robot moves slightly outside the path and arena (as it's mentioned in rule book, that there is no penalty for going out during maneuvers)?   3. One more query, now for example, the robot is performing M3 or M4, then the robot runs and falls after the maneuver (due to excess speed of the robot at the end of these moves), that is, it crosses the RD1/RD2 and buzzer rings and then it falls. Will M3/M4 be considered successful, as it met the criteria in the rule book?"
Pose Estimation using Aruco Markers	"We are trying to estimate pose of the bot using the aruco markers. The distance that is published is always multiplied by 2.5, and the yaw value is flickering by about 13 degrees, but the yaw value flickers only at certain angles the bot is placed at.What do we do to get constant values?"
Heating problem	I powered ON the entire robot and moved it around using teleop. After 10 secs one motor was getting very high power and other motor was rotating very slowly. The 7805 on Atmega2560 board and power supply board got heated up. I think there is some issue. This did not happen when only raspberry pi or only Atmega 2560 board is powered ON. What can we do to avoid such behavior when everything is powered ON?
Clarification of Rules	"When is the bot considered to be outside the arena? Is it when the axis of the bot movies outside the arena, or any other part that is outside the arena?"

Curious case of ADC in XBee S2C modules	"As some participants were complaining about ADC values in XBee S2C module.  So I thought of testing my joystick with two Xbee modules. I made one XBee module co-ordinator and another one in AT mode. The second Xbee in AT mode was configured  with GPIO0 for one digital IO for switch, and GPIO 1 and 2 for ADC channel for joystick. I also had given 3.3 V power supply to Joystick from XBee USB adapter.   Observation- So main problem was that ADC channels were always showing  3FF that is full value. While searching in the internet I found that reference voltage for Xbee S2C is 1.2 V(fixed). So to bring down the 3.3 V input voltage to 1.2 V, I added the 7.5 K resistor in series with the V+ of the joystick. Than again tested the joystick output. (As resistor of joystick was found to be 4.5K)   After adding above resistor, output of analog channel, when joystick was at center was 0x01F4 & 0x0274. When joystick was moved in x-direction, Channel 2 value was showing values from 0x0005 to 0x03FF. Then I tried the same in y-direction and it was showing the values from 0x0010 to 0x03FF.       So I hope this solves this curious case of ADC of XBee.   P. S. For setting XBee in Coordinator and API mode and another XBee in AT mode with periodic reading of Digital IOs read the previous posts(@656, @666)  on joystick.   One more problem we observe is similar to post @692. Solution to this problem, is to add 220 ohms resistor between joystick GND and GND of USB Adapter. This is to make sure that voltage from joystick never goes to zero.    "

coordinate of aruco marker	"Sir, the coordinate of the aruco marker is known by robot as we put that coordinate inside the code. Now my question is from where we get actual coordinate of the aruco marker in the map bcz in SOI list oordinate is just for arranging the block. i think from publish point in RVIZ we get coordinate plz correct me if i am wrong...!!!"
EB theme doubt	"From the post @706 , I understand that robot only knows that there are  Aruco placed at [(x1,y1) , (x2,y2) , ....etc] locations facing X or Y. But robot doesn't know its ArUco ID. So it has to go there and detect it and classify it. Suppose robot detects one ArUco at 45 degress and 2 feet away. To correct the error in its position we should know that ArUco's coordinates. But how will we know that ArUco's coordinates from SOI list if we don't know the ID. So is this the challenge of the theme? "

Doubt regarding SOI list	In Task 1.2 we specified the goal points in the script itself. From the SOI list we know the coordinates of the AruUco marker. So 2D nav goal points can be hard coded right? SOI list can be used in the code? Or is the robot required to calculate coordinates of ArUco from camera and then send goal point?  
theme implementation	Sir as our robot moves on the path made by rviz but there is error between the actual distance travel by the robot in real world and distance travel by robot in rviz because only motor encoder provide the odom for robot so this create a error in actual position and in map position of robot can u please tell us how can we handle this drift in distance using camera ??? 
Regarding Theme	Sir in the rulebook.... SOI is marked as visited only if ? EB moves towards the Object with the camera facing the marker AND  ? Output gets displayed at the Base Station irrespective of the correctness of classification.  now if my robot move through path 1 as in picture then the aruco marker is in the view of camera but after that if my robot follow the path 2 for second SOI then whether it is marked as visited or not because the camera is not able to see aruco marker during its path. 
Regarding detection of aruco maker	"Sir , we have to publish the point where obstracle is placed in the map but how we align our robot for detecting the aruvo marker as the path at which it is moving is made by RVIZ so what if the robot is coming towards the direction of SOI but the aruco marker is not visible to camera how can we align our robot to detect the aruco marker."
Bricked RaspberryPi	"Dear Instructors, our rpi used to function perfectly, but after doing a sudo reboot, the act (green) LED always remains on, We have formatted the sd card using: fdiskgpartedOfficial SD Formatter   several times and have tried 3 different sd cards: 16 GB Sandisk class 10 (provided by you)32 GB Sandisk class 108 GB Samsung class 4   Each time, the partition table type is chosen to be msdos, primary partition is chosen to be of type FAT32. We have tried ros-berry-customize.imgnoobsraspbian. We checked whether there are any errors in the filesystem by using testdisk utility, none were found. I have created an img of our sd card using dd and if you wish we can upload it here with the md5sum.     A few months back I installed NOOBs on one of my spare sdcards by following instructions given on: this site. And it did work, 2 months back that is, now rpi does not boot even when I insert that very sd card in it.   I am powering the rpi using a  2.1 A charger so I don't think power is an issue. Then I thought maybe sd card is not making proper contact with the slot, but upon careful inspection of the slot, it is unlikely to be the reason.   Will you please provide us a new rpi b+ if we mail the faulty one to you? It is very hard to find rpi b+ in the market as it is a 3 year old model, all we can find is rpi 3 and 2. We have completed 95% of the coding and configuration so it would be very disappointing to not be able to continue further because of a hardware failure.   Thank you. Team ID: eYRC-EB#1764"
Problem in ADC reading of 0 volts in XBEE	"We have setup the XBEEs properly interfaced the joystick module on AD0 and AD1 on the XBEE (Pin 20 & 19). The ADC reading is correct and as expected for all values/position of the joystick. But when the joystick output (VRx or VRy) is 0 volts, the ADC reading shoots up to 1023 (03FF) in the API data frame.We have checked the joystick output using multimeter and it reads 0 volts as expected. ADC reading is correct upto 5-10mV (ADC reading is around 10-30), below this range at about (0-4mV), ADC reading jumps to 1023.   I also tried connecting GND (Pin 10) to AD0 (Pin 20) and the reading is again 1023. Also tried disabling internal pull-up/down resistors on the XBEE (PR), problem still persists. Same problem occurs on the other ADC pins and other XBEE also. Interfaced joystick module on an Arduino and ADC works perfectly there. Please help me understand what is wrong here. Thanks!"
Robot Navigation	We have both the map and the coordinates of the SOI as inputs. Based upon these two inputs we can calculate the route of the robot.

"      Clarification regarding the criteria for marking a SOI ""visited"""	"How close exactly does EB need to get to an SOI for it to be marked visited? rulebook says that: robot has to move with the camera facing the marker for it to be marked visitedsome output should be displayed regardless of its correctness.     Say there's a site with coordinates (0, 6) and orientation: 'x' and the bot moves for 10 cm from start position along y axis (there will be a gap of approx 1.5m between camera and the site) and then displays an output (say it is inaccurate), will the site be marked visited?"
Maximum marks for Task-2	"Can you please let us know the maximum marks for Task-2 Explorer Bot? The graph is till 60, but the questions that were asked were for 29 and not 30 as mentioned before."
Balancing problem	"Sir,     While trying to balance ,  our bot tries to balance for about 3 sec but then it tries to move in one direction. If we keep our hand in front of the robot,  it keeps on pushing on our hand.It does not oscillate at all.Its like the setpoint changes automatically after some time. We are using the code from task 1 for angle calculation. We havent used any arduino library.     Please tell us where we might have gone wrong. We are using just a single balance pid. "
Launching Scripts	"Sir ,the video we have uploaded for task 3.3 we havent shown the launching of scripts.In the  sample video launching of scripts is shown.But on @580 Simranjeet sir had mentioned ""Iaunch all necessary scripts before starting the video"". Is that sufficent am tensed! Thanks      "

motor driver	"can we use a different type motor driver for task 3 balance bot, because motor driver not working"
confusion about motor velocity	"i m little confused about the publishing and subscribing thing. i have subscribed the cmd_vel and created another topic which tells us the velocity of the of both the wheels but now i enable to understand how to connect this with the actual robot. is this will be done through ""motor_publisher.py"" that you provided us or it can only be done through aurdino."
Balancing problem	"Sir , we have tuned our pid values and the bot balances itself properly but it moves too much and we are finding it difficult to keep it inside the circle for 30s  can you please advise us what to do "
Results	"The remarks mentioned by the instructors on the portal for task 2 results seem a bit over the top. making baseless accusation on our teams work and calling it copied content is very disheartening, especially because it was done with lots of efforts. its important to note that every thing anyone writes as an answer will most probably obtained from some source on the web and that makes it very obvious that some part of it matches to what is there on the web, that does not completely imply that we have just copied and pasted.Deeming our work as not our own or stating  ""Come up with your own idea rather than copying directly from other source"" is very saddening.    Thank you "
Rviz motion is not smooth	"Dear sir,       The bot in the rviz is taking stepwise motion instead of moving smoothly i.e it is switching between positions instead of traveling smoothly. What can we do to rectify it."
about task 2	"Dear Instructors, We submitted the folder and rpi testing video one day late, and microcontroller testing video 5 days late, still we got a penalty of 60 marks. Is it just a bug or does the penalty only depend on when the last sub-task was submitted?   Also as a footnote, both the encoder values were changing when only one motor's rotation was apparent because the camera was connected to raspberry pi and there's a certain delay when its output is displayed on PC, also there was a certain delay in change in encoder values being printed serially.   We are willing submit the microcontroller testing video again by connecting the webcam to PC, since to be eligible for participation certificate we have to complete all tasks satisfactorily but the option to upload previous tasks is closed."
Require a motor	Team ID EB#201 Our motor is not working. So we had ordered a new one yesterday. We were hoping we will receive it by tomorrow morning. But they have not even dispatched it yet.

Video demonstration - XCOS visualization	"1. Do we have to show the XCOS control/visualization also in the video or just the robot in the arena is enough? 2. If yes, can we show it separately at the end of the video? Because we are not using the XCOS control/visualization at the time of balancing as some sudden changes occur in the PID values sent from XCOS causing instability in balancing sometimes."
Small deviations from straight path.	"Sir, we are using the PID library of the arduino. No matter what values we set for the P,I and D coefficients, the robot always seems to stray away from the straight path. So is it normal? Do we have to show the robot moving in straight path perfectly? "
Should robot follow the right velocities	"When launching the teleop node, the default velocity it sets is 0.2m/s. When we move the robot the velocity gradually increases like 0.1->0.15->0.2 m/s . So do we have to make the robot according to these velocities? Or is it fine if we just move the robot with a constant velocity different from that in teleop node?"

Regarding Task1.1 output	"As a lot of people are facing this problem in displaying correct output for task1.1, just make sure you display correct equations in the output  of NODE3. Accordingly, change the output screen to NODE3 instead of NODE1 in the .launch file. (If done on NODE1, then it's fine)   Follow the same format to print output(as described to be done for NODE1) to display output. It's fine even if the numbers don't start from 0.   Don't worry if your output is wrong.

testing_hardware solved	"eYRC-BB #440we had finally solved our problem .2 corrections had been made1. earlier the connections of jumper were as mentioned in assembling_hardware.pdftake a look as u may see the position of jumpers are in horizontal direction.the jumpers have 3 dot up on them so u should account the jumpers are in horizontal direction.with this configuration we were clearly able to communicate between the 2 xbee module but not while running balance_bot_hardware.hex.   but what we changed the orientation vertically. like this.  you can clearly see the orientation of jumpers in vertical direction .with this configuration the  communication was working perfectly fine .       2.  as per the instruction in testing_hardware.pdf we were asked to change the parameters in xcos module in scilab which included setting right com port and baud rate.   however we changed one more parameter .   these were the parameters default in  balance_bot_task0.zcos    now these were the parameter what we changed.  we changed our baud rate, com port and input signal frame format. earlier in was a different format moreover input and output formats were diff.we changed it to match each other.       after these two changes our o/p was correct .       now i tried both of these correction simultaneously and it worked out fine. but when i tried to do only one correction at a time i failed.     i hope this would be helpful for some of us .let me know below in followup session   my question would be - is the orientation of jumpers at 2560board in horizontal and vertical direction does really have any effect ?if yes then what ?"

Understanding Systems Thinking and Classical Control Systems Theory	"In real world, there are many complex systems. It can be man made like airplanes, satellites, rockets or natural like human body, Green House effect. So to understand these, we try to make abstract models and break complex systems into various systems. For example, we see human body as various systems like Circulatory System, Nervous System, Respiratory System and so on. This abstract level of thinking is called System Thinking. Main ideas of System Thinking is taken from Control System Theory. Peter M. Senge, author of 'The Fifth Discipline', try to explain difficulties in learning this new language of System Thinking and same applies to Control System also.   Please read the following pages from Peter M. Senge's The Fifth Discipline Book: system_thinking.pdf    Similarly Classical Control System Theory consists of various new ideas and tools. These tools helps to view the world in new light - in abstract s-domain. So to be familiar with the control systems ideas and tools please go through the lectures by Brian Douglas. These are very interesting lectures on Classical Control Systems and what I like about these lectures are he makes you understand various terms of control theory with various examples and beautiful diagrams.   e-Yantra Team  "

When a question is posted on Piazza, it only needs to be answered once.  							When students post on Piazza, everyone benefits. Students like knowing that others have the same question, and when it's answered on Piazza, it's answered for everybody.   							Ask students to post their questions to Piazza instead of emailing you directly. Some instructors choose to respond to emailed questions by redirecting the students to Piazza. Others like to copy questions from emails or office hours and post them directly on the site so the answer can benefit the entire class (and save you some time!). 						 						 	    					Piazza makes it easy to post announcements to the entire class anytime. By posting announcements on Piazza, you can see any responses to the announcement all in one place rather than letting them fill your inbox.  							To post an announcement, click ""+ New Post"" and select the ""Note"" tab, which lets you create a post that does not require a response. To make the announcement to the entire class immediately, regardless of their email settings, just check the box labeled ""Send immediately to the entire class."" All members of the class will receive an email notification of the post right away. It's a great way to get important information out fast.   							 						 						 	    					Piazza's private posts make it easy to keep all instructor dialogue in one place. When creating a new post, check the box labeled ""Make this a private question."" When an instructor adds a private post, only other class instructors can view it. Look for the blue ""Private"" label in the question feed on the left.   							Students can also create private posts. When a student creates one, only that student and the class's instructors can view the post. Student-created private posts are useful for asking questions when the student is unsure whether the material may be shared with the entire class. If the post contains information that the entire class would benefit from, an instructor can always make the private post public using the menu that appears left of the question's title in the question feed.   							 						 						 	    					As soon as you've enrolled your class, let students know you're active on Piazza by adding a couple announcements.  							The first few posts are a great opportunity to share basic information about the class, like when office hours are and how you can be contacted. Many instructors also like to lay out the ground rules for posting questions and answers on Piazza.   							Add a new post by clicking ""+ New Post"" at the top of your screen and filling in the details. Select the ""Note"" tab if you're posting an announcement and don't require a response.  							 						 						 	    					Click ""Good Question"" or ""Good Answer"" to encourage students to ask questions and respond to classmates' questions.  	    					 						 						 	    					Piazza questions and answers are like Wikipedia: anyone can contribute to them. Collaboratively edited questions and answers are far easier to read and comprehend than a long thread of comments.  							The answer to each question is divided into a students' answer (for all students to edit) and an instructors' answer (for all instructors to edit). When you read a good students' answer, click ""Good Answer!"" to endorse itthis helps encourage students to answer others' questions. Plus, when students see the checkmark over the students' answer icon in the question feed, they know that that endorsed students' answer is just as good as any instructors' answer.    							Another good way to encourage students to edit the students' answer is to refine what other students have written. Anyone can view the contributions individuals made to the response by using the Question History slider that appears above the question after several edits.  							 						 						 	    					We know from experience that visual posts can communicate concepts very effectively. Embed images, attach files, and format math and code to make posts clean and easily understandable.  	    					Easily include blocks of pre-formatted code by selecting the pre button in the question editor, and include inline code snippets by selecting the tt button for teletype text. For mathematical equations, click the Fx icon to access a LaTeX editor.  							See our formatting page for more details on how to format your posts.  							 						 						 	    					Folders make it easy to filter questions by a particular assignment or topic. Classes start out and stay more organized when instructors create folders for a class before it starts. 							Specify your class's folders in your manage class page. Click the ""Manage Class"" link at the top of your screen.  							 						 						 	    					Create a hyperlink to another post by typing the ""@"" symbol followed by that post's number (e.g. @102). Find a post's number by looking in the URL, or by hovering over the arrow to the left of the question's title in the question feed.   							 						 						 	    					If you notice that a question has been asked before, mark it as a duplicate question to avoid confusion. Select the ""Mark as Duplicate"" option in the duplicate question's more menu and follow the directions. To limit the number of duplicate questions that arise, as soon as there is a significant number of posts in your class, we'll do our part to keep things organized by requiring students to search existing posts before adding their own.  	    					 						 						 	    					As an instructor, you have full editing capabilities over all class content. You can also delete posts via the more menu or question feed drop down menu. Students do not have the ability to delete posts.  							 						     				     			      		     	     	            "

Welcome to Piazza!	"Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:1.  Ask questions!The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).2.  Edit questions and answers wiki-style.Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors answer for instructors).3.  Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.4.  Go anonymous.Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.5.  Tag your posts.It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a # before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.6.  Format code and equations.Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. Mathematical equation?

Issue regarding upload of Bonus Configuration Video.	"Team ID-1776           While we were giving a final run to our bot for the bonus task, we had very less time remaining. So after shooting the video of the bonus task, when we merged the introductory video with the bonus task video, then don't know why after merging, our final video got trimmed by 7 seconds and the merged video was reduced to exactly 4 minutes, and in hurry we din't notice this mistake,  though this problem din't occur while merging the original video configuration with introductory video. Even there may have been any mistake by us while merging the videos which led the blunder.              Thus due to this we missed to show the stopping of bot on shed and blinking the LED in order at shed. Long after we uploaded the bonus video configuration we noticed our blunder. So its a big request to team e-Yantra if we could get any help or would permit us to submit the bonus configuration video again.         "

issue with detecting camera image from picam	we have different modules for each task . we try to take input from PiCam and by image processing we identify the line to follow and based on that we move our robot.(this is we want to do)   but we have tested code for single modules(only line detection and motor operations)   when we combine these two modules .then frame is loading very slowly.and due to this our motor operation module detects wrong input and robot goes straight due to black background (because slow loading of frame) and after once frame is loaded then we put it on line then it goes and after some seconds it detects another frame (that is so blurry due to speed of robot) and our code fails..   please help us in this
turning of bot	Hello Sir Can you please suggest why the robot take a soft right/left turn although we have programmed it for taking only right/left turn?
issues with controlling bot	we are having trouble controlling our bots. we are using contour detection for following the line but can't get the next frame quick enough for processing so that the robot can make a turn when track turns. we have tried reducing the resolution and frame rate is already 20. please help.

About marks for terrains traversed	"Respected Sir/Ma'am The rulebook mentions that 100 points will be awarded for each terrain traversed, we would be really thankful if you could please tell us what qualifies as traversing a terrain properly enough for it to be counted in the score. Does it need to be exactly on the line at all times, or does it simply mean that the robot shouldn't go off the line. For example, our robot, at steep turns, starts turning before the actual turn so that it may turn properly, is it fine or not? Thanking you Team PB#4097"

doubt about traversal during plucking	Consider the bot at the next(front) node of tree whose fruit must be plucked.

Similarity of arena to the one given right now	"Respected Sir/Ma'am Quoting Questions @1443 and @1140 ,  On my last question, Avijit sir answered   We have provided an arena design. Features like line thickness, types of terrain, cell size etc will remain same in the arena.    Based on the physical orientation of the camera, the line thickness visible to the robot will vary. Students are free to position the PiCam on the Planter Bot according to their own design choice.    Based on the positioning of the PiCam, things like trigonometric calculations etc will also change.  We would be really grateful if you could tell us if the arena in the finals would be same as the one we have right now?   Also, it would be a really great help if you could please tell that do the different terrains really mean anything in context of arena, like is the order pre-determined and we can hardcode optimised algorithms to traverse that particular terrain, or the names given to the terrain just imply real life implementations and the robot has to traverse arena normally with the normal algorithm it is using to traversing the rest of the arena.

Motors doubt	Sir we found that one of our motor is rotating at higher speed than the other.we got to know this after making our bot and running the same with motortest.py given in h/w testing.please guide us how to resolve this problem.
Position Encoder not working	"We tried to test the Position Encoder . So we copied the code given in the Experiments folder and pasted in new project (made in atmel studio 7 with device atmega2560) and build it. We burned the Hex file generated  but we were not getting the desired result.  We have checked the code and cross checked the configuration with Data sheet of Atmega2560 and concluded that code is correct.   After checking code, we burned the same code but reduced wheel velocity very much and tested the voltage of the output data via multimeter of the encoder. Our expectations was the voltage should go above 3.3V(for logical high) and below it( for logical low) as wheel rotates but we found that : Output voltage remain between 1.08V to 1.02V . Sometimes it remains 1.08V and and sometimes it changes to 1.02V. After this test we concluded that although code is correct but encoder is never going from high to low ( falling edge) that's why external interrupt is not getting enabled and that's why we are not getting desired result. The last thing we did to test is that we burned the Hex file provided with the position code given in Experiments folder. When we burned the Hex file the first time bot did the same we were expecting. We don't know how it did because we were burning the hex code (generated via atmel studio 7) of the same code but we were not getting the result. To cross check it we again burnt the same hex file present in the experiments folder with the code. This time bot did not worked correctly.  We don't know why it happened as we have burnt the code successfully and correctly. End conclusion: 1)By Hex code generated:      Encodersare always giving logical low . So, External interrupt is  not getting enabled. Thus unable to get  desired result. 2) Already given Hex code :      At first it worked well but when we re-burnt the same hex file it didn't worked . Please look into this issue. And tell us whether our end conclusion is correct or not. If it is correct then tell us a solution to rectify the issue ! If it seems you need more info. Then please tell us we will make a video of the issue and share it with you. Waiting for your reply !"
Placement Sequence doubt	"As per Rule book we will be provided with placement sequence.

Collector Bot	"Dear Finalists,   Congratulations!!   Please note the following points during the implementation in Finals:   1. You will not be awarded marks for FV unless you mark the current target in blue colour in V-REP. 2. Remember that there are bonus marks of 200 allotted for realistic emulation of the scenario in V-REP. 3. The Rule 4 under Re-position rules which says ""If Fruits in Collection Area are displaced, they are placed back in the original locations. If this is caused by collision with CB, teams will be penalized according to the Judging and Scoring parameters."" is replaced with the new rule, ""If in any case, Fresh fruit gets displaced/falls and you feel that you will not be able to detect it further, then e-Yantra team will remove the displaced Fresh Fruit on your request. If the displaced Fresh fruit is not removed, the penalty will be incurred on collision with CB or Truck"" 4. All teams should use PWM greater than 210 for Truck's black line following. Also, make sure that the Truck stops at all the collection stations for only 10 seconds and not more than that. 5. Make sure that you fully charge the Truck and CB before the run. 6. You should strictly follow the Re-position rules as mentioned in Rulebook. You are not allowed to change the position of the fruits. 7. As mentioned in the Rulebook, The run will end if you display the text ""FRUITS COLLECTED"" on a pop up window in V-REP. No marks will be awarded after you display the same. 8. Penalty is incurred each time when the CB touches/ displaces any other object in the arena except the current target.    E.g.: Even if any part of CB touches the already collected fruit or Truck, then the penaty will be incurred.   All the best!!   #pin"

[IMPORTANT] Kindly note	"  Greetings from e-Yantra!     Dear Participants,   The competition closes on 26th February, 11:59 PM.   Hence, teams who had downloaded their Original configuration well before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM can still submit their task before the competition closes with penalty as per the policy on portal.   Teams who downloaded the configuration just before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM have only 48 hours to submit their task. No submission for Original configuration or for Code submission will be considered (even via an email) after 26th February, 11:59 PM.   Hence, we request teams to kindly pace up their work and avoid last moment rush.   Teams should submit their Original task with Code well before the deadline, maybe by 9 or 10 PM tomorrow. Many teams try to submit their task at the last moment due to which the server gets loaded and then they aren't able to submit their task on time. So, please avoid such situations for your benefit.     You can download the Bonus configuration even with penalty or zero score on Original configuration till 26th Feb, midnight.    But, the last date to submit the video for Bonus task is 26th Feb, midnight. Though there is no penalty for Code and Bonus video submission, the submission won't be considered after 26th Feb midnight.   All Teams kindly note this, no extensions will be entertained in any case.     Thank you.   All the best !!     #pin"

You are free to add any dummy or object.   Keep in mind that there will be marks for creativity in finals. Creativity is the measure of how exactly your simulation arena represents the original scenario. E.g., Texture of garden, road, collection stations, Fresh and Damaged Fruits shown with different textures etc.    Though there is no weightage for creativity now(in video submission), we recommend you to work on the asthetics of the simulation from now.   Note: Successful run ends when CB deposits all the fresh fruits in the Truck and a pop up window appears in the V-REP with the text FRUITS COLLECTED.

Here are some important task you need to understand and complete.   1. Waypoint navigation : After completion of drone holding, Complete the waypoint navigation of drone. Give some waypoints in the code and Navigate the drone to those waypoints. Challenges: Navigation of drone in the corner waypoints of frame. Hint: Set some offset for the corner cases.   2. Landing the drone on static marker: After completing the first point. Try to land the drone on static marker. Fix the marker somewhere in the arena and try to land the drone on that marker. Again change the position of marker and so on. Challenge: 1.  When two markers are in the frame. correct identification of drone marker and second marker(static).                   2. When one marker overlap on the another, there will be no detection for single marker(because your target is changed from 2 to1). Hint: Use the whycon/reset service to change the target in run time.   3. Line(path) follow of runner: Write a code for runner that runner follow the path given in the runner list. We have written the code for your ease and you can downloaded the code from here line_follow_sparkv.zip. This Folder contain the code block project Challenges: Thresholding of the sensor.Hint: Carefully analyse the Sensor value and decide the thresholding.   4. Landing of drone while runner is moving: Try to land the drone while runner is moving in the arena. (first try without caves). Challenges: Increasing the accuracy of drone to land when runner is waiting at node for 2 seconds. Hint: Use the laser sensor on drone and whycon z coordinate data with filter to check drone is on the above of Runner. 5. Action when Runner enter into cave: Detection of cave from code. Take a appropriate action. Challenge: Detection of Cave: Because there is no marker on the cave. Hint: You can Choose accroding to accuracy.6. Detection of Drone sucessfull landing on Runner: Using Sensor you have to detect the landing of drone on the runner, Runner Should stop when drone lands on the Runner. Challenges: Placement of sensor on runner to detect the landing of drone. Hint: Check the scoring formula.

Factors to be considered while implementing the theme	"Dear Participants,   Congratulations guys, all of you are doing great work. Those who have yet to submit Task 3, don't get discouraged. You still have a good chance to get into finals. Submit it soon to avoid further penalty.   Now it is time to increase your pace. Indeed you have a lot of time to implement the theme, but if you end up wasting your time now hoping to do it in last week or so, i assure you that you will end up wasting a golden opportunity to win the competition. So pedal up now and accelerate towards success and grab that opportunity.   Following are some of the important factors you need to consider while implementing the task: Placement of camera with respect to arenaRobot chassis design for CB Material for constructionDistribution of weight or position of C.GDifferential drive mechanismOverall size of the robot Placement of ArUco marker on CBArm design in CB Actuators (You can use the provided servo motors or any other actuators you want with the consent of e-yantra team)Required Degree of Freedom for armPicking and Dropping location of arm Implementing P,P-D or PID control for motion Starting PWM of motorsDetermination of offsetMapping PWMTuning of Kp, Kd or KiBest method to Debug to see if CB is following the path or not (hint: link) Designing of Bin for Truck Material for constructionSize of BinPosition of Bin with respect to SparkVPosition of Bin at collection stationsWeight of Truck with Fruits Position of ArUco marker on TruckNumber of Fruits to be deposited in Truck at a time Pros and cons of having a collection mechanism in CB itself and dropping multiple fruits in Truck at one goComplexity of design.

Spotter snake	"  Greetings from e-Yantra!   Dear Participants,   With the completion of Task 4, you will be heading towards the Theme implementation. The only task left over will be Theme implementation and sending a video of your implementation with the arena configuration provided (the details will be conveyed soon).   Teams are expected to start brainstorming and think in this direction:   1. How the Transmitter and Receiver system must be designed for the final Spotter Snake.   2. What components are necessary and how they must be interfaced in both these systems. How communication will be established successfully, i.e. exchange of data between controller and robot. This is the most important aspect and teams must start implementing this as soon as their Task 4 is completed.   3. The weight distribution of various components on the Snake's body so as to balance them all while it is maneuvering on the given arena.   4. Implementing tasks to be completed by Snake robot while traversing the arena and planning a strategy to score and fetch maximum marks as per the scoring formula, keeping all the Rules in mind.   5. The last step that can help you reach in Finals.. Practice, practice and practice! After writing scripts, team must practice by traversing the Snake robot on the arena, so as to avoid penalties and get more marks.     The 3D printed brackets will reach to teams by 20th January. Teams are expected to think and plan on the above points and can then execute their plan as they receive their printed brackets.     All the Best..!!     Happy Learning! Cheers!   #pin"

We have observed that many teams have submitted a video that is edited and/or also have used some video editing tools to fasten the simulation. Teams have also submitted videos where the Information Text is hidden, despite of instructing many times... We have no other option than deducting marks for such teams and loose them in Stage 2 even though their designs were good enough.

Please do not zip your files in any other format other than .ZIP     Once you have your final bracket designs ready, you will be ready with all the details for 3D printing the brackets, (the types of brackets, quantity of each bracket to be printed, volume of each bracket and total brackets to hold 3 servo motors). Go to the portal and find the page ""3D Printing Details"".   Only the team leader can fill these details.   Kindly provide correct address of team leader along with State and Pincode where you want the 3D printed brackets to be shipped. We advise to not provide your institute's address as it will cause unnecessary delay in you receiving the brackets, if the institute is closed on the day when the brackets are shipped to the location.   Kindly read the ""3D PRINTING INSTRUCTIONS"" on the same page carefully. Note that you have to submit the .stl and .step files of each bracket type separately with each file having the names as instructed in Instructions file.   Also, kindly note that you have to submit these files in a folder with the given name and ZIP them. Kindly upload only .ZIP file having all the .stl and .step files of your bracket types. Before exporting the bracket component into .stl and .step, DO NOT FORGET TO ENGRAVE YOUR TEAM_ID on each bracket component. If no TEAM_ID is found on your brackets, then even if you complete Task 1 successfully and are eligible to qualify for Stage 2, your brackets won't be 3D printed and your team will be disqualified.     KINDLY FILL THE DETAILS ON PORTAL VERY CAREFULLY, AS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REFILL THE DETAILS LATER. e-Yantra will not be responsible for any discrepancy in this matter.

Details about accessing Nodes	I want to know if the node points will be given by you or we can set them and additionally the drone have to pass the node or to hold at the node for a moment of time and how much error is bearable in accessing nodes.
Doing the necessary changes in the bot.	"Respected Sir,   Can we do the changes in the Joystick like adding an extra push button on it.   Regards, Naman Gupta (eYRC#145)"
Camera Calibration in Final	We have performed calibration for our camera input as per given advice. Should we use our camera or will we get time to calibrate your camera before performing at final?
We got almost 15 less days as compared to other teams for completing task 5.	Delivery of Packets took time to reach us in JandK. Competition was good and we are in top teams do we get any appreciation for that haha.... .We really didn't got time to improve our controlling skills and try different gaits
Teams At Eyantra Finals	"SirAs per updated marks distribution graph, we are in top 6, so my question is,how many teams are coming for finals at IITB."
Marks distribution graph for task 5	"Is it possible now for you to update the marks distribution graph just based on marks obtained in task 5 (original config, bonus config and code)? as it will help us to know how much we need to improve and as the total mark distribution graph for total marks is not required at all now."
modification of codes for finals	can we modify our codes for finals?
Modifications for finals	Can we do modifications now in the snake for finals which were remained due to lack of time? We want to use some extra passive allowed components.
regarding code	Sir we can upload the code to opensource or not. 
regarding maximum marks	"maximum marks a team can score, considering a team completes task in 0 sec(which is not possible) and without any penalties comes to be:- 1500(main task)+1900(bonus task)=3400(without code)Sir, can you tell if the above calculations is right?or if it's wrong please correct us. And can you provide the calculation for maximum marks that can be scored!"
Number of teams who completed task 5	"Hi this is a question out of curiosity.. this question is not towards the instructors but a discussion among the participant teams... So, how many teams have completed the Spotter snake theme and submitted task 5 before deadline? If your team have completed the theme, write your team id.. Then we can know how many teams have actually completed the task and what are the chances of going to the finals."
Selection for finals	Is there any limit for how many teams can be selected for finals from same college or is it dependent on each teams performance irrespective of the college?
This is regarding opening of the portal for video and code submission.	"Sir, We have successfully uploaded the video but we can't find the link to upload the code. "
Regarding video and code submission	"Sir,      We have uploaded the video successfully but we can't find the link on the portal to upload the code."
Confusion regarding penalty deadline	"We thought we had an option to submit the task with penalty 2 days after 26th Feb.  We had took one video but was not so satisfactory. We decided to take the penalty , do it much better and submit it today.  But the portal says the competition is closed today. We tried really hard and this is really disappointing. It's a communication mistake and please allow us to atleast complete the video submission.  SS#1318"
Regarding Submission	"Sir, We were not clear regarding the rule.. We thought that we can upload the video and codes till 26 + 2 (with penalty).i.e till 28th of feb with two penalties. please allow us to submit our task. We have now completed our task . We have been working really hard and were in top 8 in task3. Please allow us to submit our task.... We will be very thankful if you allow us Thankyou."

Nrf module malfunction.	" Sir, the nrf modules were working fine till today morning and we started our test runs by afternoon today. Everything worked fine and we were planning the path of the bot but suddenly the bot stopped receiving any form of command given by us and we tested the nrf modules with test code and found that the modules aren't working properly. We tried to debug it till now and we couldn't, looks like they malfunctioned and our original deadline closed at 10:30 today. I have attached the code we worked on and few videos of our snake bot performing various gaits.We have put in a lot of effort into our bot, please consider it and give us a deadline extension to work with, we have ordered nrf modules and it'll be delivered to us within two days and we just have to attach it with our controller and take a video of our bot performing a perfect run. We have also uploaded the progress video, kindly take a look at it.? We have also mailed the code and video to helpdesk@e-yantra.org Hoping for a positive response from you, Thank you. Team ID: SS#504"
re upload option	We are not able to find re upload option @2223
regarding collision penalties	"Does a collision with a previously collided fruit count a new collision when calculating the penalty? i.e. say the CB collides with a fruit and it gets displaced, which leads to further collisions ... will the number of collision be just one  or more??"
Perfect Run	"sir ,what is exact meaning of a perfect run ,i.e. 1) snkae has to detect all rodent successfully. or   2) it has to traverse the arena with NO PENAULTY.   or both  kindly answer  ASAP. thank you..."
Refering @2223	There is no option to upload againeYRC2017Track2_je4hqj8p1o4s.png
Option to re upload code zip file	Can you please tell where the option for reuploading zip file is Refering to @2222
Regarding documented code submission	We have uploaded documented code before bonus configuration download. So we did not know that we have to add screencast video of bonus configuration in the same zip file. Also it wasn't mentioned specifically anywhere else that we have to submit the screencast video of bonus configuration within the zip file. So we ask you to kindly consider our case and guide us on what can be done as soon as possible
Failure of the servo in collector bot	eYRC: 5084 One of the servo failed to work when testing. We have mailed the code and video of it's failure through mail (helpdesk.e-yantra.org) as we cannot post it here. Please help!
One Bracket outside arena	it was mentioned in rulebook that if more than one bracket goes outside arena then marks will be deducted.It's ok that one bracket goes outside right? The head of the snake is considered one bracket and if that goes outside for a few seconds no marks are cut right?
Regarding Bonus Video	"Sir, If we submit the original configuration video without the penalty and download the bonus configuration , and submit bonus video after time( with penalty), then penalty will be on only bonus, or original configuration as well ??"
regarding video	"sirin our video while detecting one rodent, the head is on the other side of the camera which means that the buzzer is sensing but  the LEDs are not visible. this happened for  detection of only one rodent but in all other rodents the led has given the proper colour and is visible . Please dont consider it as wrong detection of rodent. this can be verified from our code too.team ss#3763"
Camera not reading	"Sir, The camera is not reading...it is not working,while the indicating light is on."
About Screencast Video Submission	The size of the Screen cast video which is said to be uploaded along the code and other documentation has large size. But the size of zip which is to be uploaded is limited to the 10MB. How can we send the zip file.
final_arena.ttt	"respected sir ,i forgot to add final_arena.ttt in documented code folder"
Bonus video submission	"Will there be a penalty on the submission of the bonus video submission if the video is submitted after 48 hrs of downloading the original configuration.  As on the portal it is written : "" You can submit the Bonus Configuration till Midnight, February 26th, 2018 when the competition closes. No extensions will be allowed.""   If there will be no such penalty, how can we submit the screencast video for bonus configuration along with the  screencast for original configuration? Cause the original code submission will be penalised after 48 hrs. "
Motor port	One of the ports for our motor has just come off the board. What should we do? 
"      Do we have to send Screencast video of Bonus Configuration Demo, if yes, then where?"	The 'ReadMe.pdf' of Bonus Configuration needs us to submit Bonus Configuration Demo video with a screencast video of the bonus configuration demo. But where are we supposed to upload the screencast video.
Regarding video for bonus configuration	In the video which we have taken for bonus configuration for some time there is little darkness because we tried to focus on laptop screen although the arucos  and the bot are visible . Is that okay?
Regarding the uploading of the Introductory video	"Dear sir,   We've been asked to shot an introductory video (as per the ReadMe pdf) but the e-yantra portal does not contain the option to share the submission link (the portal does contain the option of sharing the link pertaining to the Demonstration-OneShotContinuous and Demonstration-Screencast videos only)"
Please extend the deadline	"Sir, we are very close to complete the task, can you give us some extra time. Our most of the time was wasted due to the camera, as the viewing angle of camera was very less, we faced a lot problem in placing the camera at the required height. Now we are using our phone instead of camera, so please give us some extra time"
Final Task	"Has anyone completed the task , or is near to complete the task????????????????????"
regarding task 5 marks	sirHow is task 5 going to be marked ?only the points gained in arena will matter or coding also has weightage ?
Marking scheme queries	"1) How many marks will be deducted for dashing into same object multiple times? 2) If 4-5 brackets go out the arena while accessing objects in the corner, how much will be the penalty? 3) For n false detections on the same rodent,the penalty will be n times 50 or just 50?"
Regarding snake's motion.	"Sir, when we reorient the snake and place it in on one side, the snake stops receiving the command."
regarding Angle Fluctuation of CB	VERY URGENT sir VREP is actually calculating larger angle than the required angle to reach the fruit due to which it is moving in random direction.
Regarding video clearity	The intensity of leds is somewhat dimmed due to sunlight and may not be clearly visible in low resolution . So we kindly request you to watch it on big screen with good resolution(1080p). Laptop screen will be sufficiently good. we have tried our best to record the video but on the terrace the sunlight was too much. so  we couldn't do anything. i know its late to tell you about this after submission of video ...but plz suggest us  something if u can.SS#1201
nRF24l01 Malfunction	"Till Yesterday both the modules were working fine but after soldering a few parts of the nrf module it started creating problems, it even damaged one of the board, so when we searched for nrf module in the nearby stores they had nrf module with antena attached to it is it fine if we use it, please reply as soon as possible"

Regarding video	Can we record introduction and demonstration part of video seperately and then merge them?
Regarding buzzer.	"Sir, can we beep the buzzer using the joystick when the run is to be started or should it also be autonomous just like the beeping of buzzer as in case of rodent detection?"
path tracking	"Sir we have passed velocities to the cb from vrep. and but physical cb is not moving as per path created. it is moving forward ,backward and stops correctly at position as per path but on turns it is giving error. it is tacking less turn as campared to simulation. eg. in simulation if cb takes 180 degree turn but in reality it takes only 50. We have found initial pwm of both the motors and mapped them with help of vrep velocity. We have send taken cb co-ordinates from camera feed and same from V-rep and then calculated error as per @2055  but we are not getting desired result . we have stuck here from past 3 days so pls help  "
Unable to import .msg and .srv file	We have been trying to import .msg and .srv file from their respective packages but we are not able to do so. But .py file present their are easily imported. What can be done please reply asap.
Collector Bot	Sir we have passed velocities to the cb from the station we are able to take turns when negative velocities are passed but cb is not following the path as per V-rep simulation we are stuck at this point we need help  We have send taken cb co-ordinates from camera feed and same from V-rep and then calculated the distance between this which is error but we are not getting desired result 
regarding hurdles	Sirwould we incur a penalty if snake touches the hurdle ?
regarding end of run	Sir Can we manually end the run on our discretion even if the time is left and all rodents are not detected ?
regarding bonus configuration	SirWill we be able to download bonus configuration if we submit the original configuration after 26th ?
Question regarding end of run	What is exact indication of end of run?Is it 5 times buzzer or successful detection of all rodents?
servo software pwm	"Sir  Since we have 7 servos to connect to our nano, and a nano has only 6 pwm pins we are using software pwm  with the servo.h library. Is it okay?Or should we code software pwm ourseves using timer interrupts."

Portal says competition closed	 Where do we upload the video link??
Doubt regarding code submission	Are the above names of codes are just examples ?we have two seperate codes for two receivers  and one for transmitter.one of the two receiver arduino codes have the colour sensor code. But we have taken care that the rodent detection is autonomous. we have not dedicated one nano just for colour sensing so no seperate colour_detection code.And no instrustion has ever been provided regarding seperate nano for colour detection. so our folder will contain three codes transmitter receiver1receiver2and one readme file for discription(if u ask)plz suggest us correction if any...
Regarding colour sensor	"Sir, we are facing a problem with the colour sensor. The sensor senses green only when the green colour is at very near to it but red when we take any green colour to it at a ditance of 1 cm or above, the problem is persistent with every frequency sclaing."
regarding video submission	sir i have submitted the screencast video and original video but in original video i didn't include introduction so is there any option for giving another submission of original video?
Regarding Video	"hello Sir , please can i know where to submit the introduction video "
Regarding Team Video	URGENT   sir One of our teammates might not be present in final team video due to some family issues.So can we submit the video without him.
When to Switch ON the TRUCK	"When should we switch on the Truck, just after the initializations in Python script are over OR right after starting the execution of the python file? Because the initialization code takes considerable amount of time .   Please help!"
Regarding Multi threading.	Are we permitted to use python's threading library to perform pany tasks at the same time. Because vrep takes a lot of time and affects open cv.
"      Collector bot cant move forward, its like facing imaginary obstacle."	"Sir,        Meanwhile traversing the path collector bot is facing some obstacle, velocity however is transmitted correctly. Here is video link :https://youtu.be/x49KgDbIwVE Please help. Thanks again."
Regarding operator position	Is operator/controller of snake allowed to move as the snake orientation changes? The controller will remain outside the arena but can he move along the four sides of the arena? The joystick in the hands of operator is captured in the video from the start but for few time joystick is not captured in the video when operator is at the corner side. Is it ok ?
Live video feed inside of a loop.	"Sir,  Whenever code is inside some continuous loop (say while) it won't read video frame. For example in moving bot on the path a while is used, while it traverses the path video frames are unread, non responsive. But in order to stop the bot within threshold distance, we need to stop bot, how do i do that. Thanks."
Regarding Task 4 Screencast Video	"It was not mentioned before that we should show camera frames. If we do so now, there will be major changes in our currently working code as our current algorithm is not ""frame by frame"". As we are capturing frames distinctively in different functions as per our need, so can we upload screencast video without camera output? "
Problem regarding nrf communication	"Team ID #279   Sir, We had made nrf communication by making circuit on breadboard. We also made our own code and had established successful communication. But now as we implemented the same circuit on pcb and uploaded the same code then the communication is not happening. We troubleshooted the circuit and everything was ok. We also checked the code twice that is also the same we made before. At the last time its not working.....what should we do now?   Please reply as soon as possible"
Regarding Code submission	Which all codes should we submit for Collector Bot theme
Control of snake robot	Can joystick change hands during a run?
Query regarding submission	Should the .ttt file that we submit be tailored for the original configuration or should be generic so as to work for any configuration? (With regard to objects in the scene)
Deposition of Fruits	Should the fruits be deposited in the truck only when the truck has stopped at a station or is it ok to deposit the fruits on the go?
Doubts regarding task 4 submission	"Sir, We have a few doubts: 1) Should Introduction video be a part of one shot continuous video of demonstration video? 2) In screencast video, for point 2 ""window showing each frame of overhead camera"", should the ArUco Ids be marked and should the frame be cropped? 3) We did not find uploading link of YouTube video on the portal Please help us to clear the doubts Thank you   "
PID algorithm	How to implement PID algorithm. Can you share any links
regarding problem in nano	"SirThe program is uploaded correctly on nano but after upload the nano does not function. This is happening to us 2nd time. The nano seems to function normally but then suddenly it behaves like this. We have checked all things and the circuit is fine. We uploaded blink and checked nano. it's fine. And the code we have uploaded we have tried it countless times in the same nano and it worked, but nano behaves abnormally like this.could you please help in this case ?"
Regarding Lipo battery.	"Sir, our battery is draining very quickly. Can we use battery of 2200mAh instead of 1500mAh battery?"
Regarding battery charging circuit	"Our battery charger circuit has suddenly stopped working. when connected to ac supply, only one led is glowing and another two leds are not glowing for both cases- battery connected and not connected.

Orientation for picking fruit.	"Sir,      Every time a dynamic path is generated,collector bot is not always facing the fruit. How do i make sure that robot always faces the fruit? For eg:"
ardunio nano problem	"when the nano is attached to the laptop, the option for selecting the port is not available. when we attach another nano, the option for  selection for port is shown. what might be the reason for this?"
import not working	Team Id #1943 Chaser_Drone   I am in same folder and trying to import.. but its showing error. i tried sys.path.insert also.. but no change.    why import is not happening? we are using :   https://github.com/simmubhangu/pid_tune   and   https://github.com/simmubhangu/whycon   but we are stuck with import. we tried a lot please reply ASAP.
Xbee Data Problem	"The UART Library has a method for receiving Data byte by byte, but since we are sending a String from python. Could you provide us with any suggestions on how do we receive the data at Atmega using uart_rx() We tried using a loop but it only recieves the initial character."
Regarding video	Can we record our introduction part and the whole run separately and merge them together? The whole run will be recorded in one shot.
Issue with lm338 circuit	"We are facing critical issue with lm338. Our snake is functioning as desired for few minutes after that power delivered to the snake reduces. We thought maybe ic was malfunctioning, but we replaced them quite a few times, we tried distributing load to 3 lm338 ic's but proper functioning time only increases for few more minutes.  Is there any other team facing same issue?  We request instructors to help us figure out issue. Is it a hardware or software fault.    PS: when we drive snake with external power supply, it works just fine for the longer duration."
"      Accessing bonus task, buzzer pattern"	"1. Where will the bonus task appear as there is no tab for it on portal? 2. How should the start buzzer buzz?    Buzz(2 seconds) - off (1 second) - buzz (2 seconds) - off Is this correct? 3. For end buzzer buzzer should be on ON for 1 second and off for 1 second. This should happen 5 times right? 4. In arena configuration file, will there be image of arena or only the table for placement will be there? If only table is there, for the case of rodent on ramp, on which side of ramp from middle peak the rodent should be placed?"
Regarding start zone	"SirAs per the rules the whole bot should be in start zone but as we can't give exact position to servos , the bot would be a little outside while placing in the start zone.Is this fine ?"
regarding repositioning	"SirAs mentioned in the rulebook while repositioning, it is written that only one  member of the team can help in repositioning of the snake. But as we are using more number of servos, it would be difficult for one person to move snake from position to another. can two people enter and move the snake ?Because if one person carries it then there would be a chance of breakage from middle."
regarding task 5 submission	sir is the deadline of the bonus configuration same as the original configuration for spotter snake ?
Error in whycon reset	Team#1943   We have made the changes accordingly... but its not working.

Is it ok if the Collector Bot moves out of collection area	Is it ok if Collector Bot moves out of collection area while picking fruits.
Doubt regarding dropping fruit.	Is it ok if the Collector Bot drops the fruit after the Truck has just started to move after stopping for 10 seconds. Or should the fruits be dropped in those 10 seconds only?
One xbee malfunctioning.	"One of our xbee is suddenly malfunctioning. I've tried reconnecting it many times. Tried updating firmware from recovery but it didn't work. Also tried reinstalling drivers, also didn't work. Every time we try to add radio module in xctu it says error message, then when we try to update firmware, it says no active bootloader found. (We already changed the permission of this port to 777) Also Assosiate LED is not blinking. Other xbee seems to be working fine, so i don't know whats wrong with this. Please guide as soon as possible."
Need permission to use 3rd servo motor	"Sir,   We need permission to use a 3rd servo motor for our task."
segmentation fault	  the code runs efficiently for some time but suddenly after 1 or 2 fruit collection this error occurs and exits  it happens when I use simsetobjectposition to place truck and fruits in vrep.. if i remove those lines code runs correctly can anyone help me out on this thanks in advance 
value of the output of ir sensor changes randomly	"sir, when the output of the top ir sensor (using adc channel 7) is displayed on LCD the value doesn't show any trend , rather varies randomly. What to do next ?    "
nRF modules coding	"The present codes we are using for radio communication uses 3 libraries ,one for SPI communication, one that is specific to nRF24l01 and an RF24 out of which only nRF24l01 is in embedded c ,the rest are written in arduino language.Should we change those libraries to embedded C too? PS : the rest of the code like ADC reading of joystick values is in embedded C "
regarding arduino nano	"sir,during the run of our spotter snake, sometimes the arduino gets restarted. and thus the snake performs the gait all over again during the motion. we tried to find solutions for this problem but we couldn't find any. please suggest solution to this."
Xbee communication problem	"Respected Sir, The communication through xbee module is okay for first  few seconds but later after some time the signal is not received in proper format..please help.. Is PID necessary??"
Using the microservo.	Sir is it necessary to use the microservo?
Doubt regarding Rule	"SirWe have a small doubt regarding on of the theme rule as quoted below""When the team is ready to start the run, the Snake Robot should beep the buzzer for 2seconds each.""What that this rule mean. We need to beep 2 times with 2 second interval or beep one time for 2 sec."
regarding attach and detach servo motor	SirThere is an anomaly while using attach and detach of servo motor. When using detach without delay the servo isn't getting enough time to achieve the positions. And if we use delay then the motion of servo becomes slow because we are giving the positions in a loop so adding delay in between would not give smooth movement.What should we do ?
regarding voltage of lm338	Sir when servos are not connected lm338 are giving 5.5 volt output ( enough to drive the servo motor ). But when connected to servo motor through jumper wires the voltage is 2.2 volt . why is this happening ?Is it enough to drive the servo ?Or we need to set the lm to give voltage around 7 volt as voltage drop is around 2.5 volt and the servo need around 5 volt to operate . A problem in above solution is that the servo has a operating limit of 6 volt so would it be safe to do the above thing because if the same voltage drop is not there then our servo is at risk.
Final Task 4 Creativity Bonus	Will creativity bonus points be considered in FINAL TASK 4? Is it necessary to show Head Design/added functionality or do we only need to show the theme implementation?
Should the truck wait at station 1	Should the truck wait at station for 10 seconds(for the first time) when we start the simulation.
Team ID:1326 Cant Upload hex file even after programmer is recognised	" Sir, We are unable to program Spark V, the error is Device connection We have uploaded many times on the Spark V before but suddenly this problem has confronted us.

Regarding SparkV robot	"Sir,   Please inform once the SparkV robot has been dispatched from your side. We will notify you of the tracking id once we send it from our side.   Team : eYRC#83"
"      Download links  for 'Collector Bot.ttm' , 'Truck.ttm' and 'final_arena.ttt'? Or where to find them?"	"It has been mentioned in CB rulebook (page no.: 15,16) that teams must use 'final_arena.ttt' file, provided in Task 4. And also to get the ttm models from the previous tasks. But, the previous tasks had no .ttm models, and V-REP does not allow to export model as .ttm. (other formats like .obj, .stl works, but when imported back, it imports as a single merged model without joint handles, etc.).   So can links be provided for downloading the above mentioned files, since the deadline had been changed to 22nd?  "
Bot breaks after starting simulation	"The bot breaks just after we start the simulation with the remote API call and reset its position. How can we solve this problem?   Also, are we supposed to use synchronous mode anywhere?"
Receiver module	When Arduino nano is powered up laptop the transmitter and receiver are working normally. But when it is powered by LiPo battery the radio.available() will always be true and no data will be received by the receiver module. Transmitter is working fine and there is no issue with the power supply as other codes are working fine. Can we please get some suggestions about this?
Regarding position of buzzer	Is it necessary to place the buzzer on the snake bot ? Or can we have it on joystick?
SparkV not working properly	"sir, we are trying to load hex file in sparkV. On one laptop its working properly...but when i tried same thing on my team-mate's laptop...its showing this error."
SparkV Code	"sir,  it may be a little rude but i would like to ask if the code you sent for line follower is tested or not.because when we tried following line through it by making a few changes (threshold values and other comparing values) it won't give expected result.it has many problems,when checking logic carefully, and observing field values we have found out that1. At any conditions black and green have around same values(5-10 points gap )2. The black line is so thin, ADC conversion takes too much time to get new value and black line is skipped at speed 200+3. The distance between green and black line is actually somehow matching the distance between right and left white line sensor and hence its not able to detect at what position it is (the right white line or left white line)4.also the position of one buzzer is interfering with proper sensitivity of one sensor(its black colored and always gives more values then other)5. due to less thickness, black line gives less values compared to green (when sensor is on green, it will be absorbed more  while when on black it will get partially absorbed and partially reflected from side white color if i try to follow line based on black line then logic gets completely reverted if by mistake or due to any above reasons the sensor detect edge of green area as black line if i try to follow line based on green area with outside sensors then it will show dumping a lot and misses the node..so please will you be kind enough to tell me if this code is tested or not so that i can decide whether i should figure out any more special conditions to make your code work for me or should i write my own code for this.Time is running out and i have already spent a lot of time on that code.should i give it one more try if its worth it or is it just for reference and getting familiar with sensor's configuration...thank you"

Drone Landing	"Sir, Team Id: 5457   During run-time both the drone and the runner would be in motion so how to set the marker number specifically to each of them. We have seen other posts, where it was mentioned to use reset method, but we don't know how to apply it. Reset scans the area once again for the detection of marker but how it helps we are not able to understand that.   Secondly our drone reaches a stationary point (where second whycon is placed ), but as it overlaps, the two markers stop getting detected. We are not able to understand what will be the value of pose in this case, we tried using an if condition with null but it was not successful. "

Can we metal perforated chassis available and permission to use 3rd servo motor.	"We are from team eYRC#255 . Collector Bot.  Respected Sir/Ma'am, Can we use metal perforated chassis, as shown in picture below:Can we please get permission to use a third servo motor?"
Regarding chances of getting into finals	"Hi sir, Our team CB#437 had a penalty of 40 marks in task 3. But all the tasks submitted by us were good and we also got really good scores (above 90 in all the three tasks till now -neglecting the penalty in task3).   We couldn't submit task 3 before the deadline because we had to attend SHAASTRA2018(IIT-M). We even won two prizes there.   The idea of penalty is a bit discouraging for all the team members.  So our final score in task 3 (including penalty of 40 marks ) is 51.   Do we have any chances of getting into the finals? Would eYantra consider our score (neglecting the penalty) ?   Thank you."
Task 4 results	"We got a low score in this task, due to reason being: answers less descriptive. May be our answers were less descriptive but we are confident in completing the task, will these marks affect our final selection, thank you."
Chaser drone-doubts	"Sir we had the following  doubts regarding drone- 1.after running the script the numbering of the two markers static and drone keep interchanging, how do we tackle this?  2. The z whycon coordinates are different at the same level across different areas of arena, how to we handle this?  3.

Regarding Transmitter circuit	"Sir,We have made a joystick circuit which includes nano, joystick and NRF module. The problem we face is the nrf module has to be removed from the circuit for any code to be uploaded to the Nano. If the nrf module is connected, Nano is not even being recognized as a port in the device manager. The same problem exists in different laptops. The connections are the same as that provided in the Hardware testing circuit. Also the Nano is working; the joystick values were obtained. What could be the reason to this?SS#13"

Regarding submission of progress video.	Hello instructor. We are having our assesment exams right now. Since you said the progress video was not mandatory we thought of starting the work after our assesment and now you have updated the message and we saw it only today. With the assesments going on it is impossible for us to get the progress video before deadline. So please I assure you that if you grant us one week extra we will have it ready and submit it. Only because you guys said the video was not mandatory we didn't focus on this for a few days as this assesment is important for us. Please do grant us one week extra and I assure you we will have it ready by then. We have a tight schedule and we will get free only on thursday of next week and we have to ready the bot on the next two days. Please reply Immediately. Our team ID is #2399IMG20180118WA0057.jpg
Problem with hex file generation in Code Blocks	"Team id: eYRC#83   Dear Admin,   We are facing a problem with the hex file generation in code blocks. We are unable to generate a hex file. Apparently, a post-build command is required to do so.   We would like to know what the post-build command is. Nex robotics also seems unaware of the command.    "
Regarding Hangout Session	"Sir, Can we have a hangout session? Team id:- SS#1755"
Relating to PWM	"We have load sample.hex code in ATmega2560 for testing and understanding PWM velocity and it is quite good. But when we give velocity(100,100) there is no response in DC motor, it is happening because 100 is not enough velocity when we apply 255 DC motor rotates well. So this is a problem or it is normal thing?   And  In VREP simulator we are generating w_r and w_l between approx(0,6) but that input we have to give in ATmega2560 using XBee communication. So we need to convert that anguler velocity in between (0,255), On which basis we can convert it? Using Emulation or some other thing?"
Permission to use DC motor instead of servo	"Among the two servo motors that have been provided to us, we are planning on using only one. The second degree of freedom is achieved using a DC motor instead.   Kindly give us permission to go ahead with our design. eYRC#2483  "
Heat Sink	"Sir, What would you recommend, it is fine to use single big heat sink for two voltage regulators instead of two small heat sinks?"
Velocity transfer from pyserial	"We are able to transfer data using pyserial to xbee, however the velocity calculated in vrep simulation is in float and sometimes even negative whereas the data transfer in serial mode can just be byte by byte. How can we deal with this problem and scale the velocity of the CB in the same way as we have it in vrep for proper emulation?"
Unable to complete Task 3	"We tried our best and tried whatever we could to complete this task, but we were unable to do it. Are we out of this competition for not completing the task3 (chaser drone)?  If yes, What do we need to do with the spark V?  If no, is there any chance for us getting in the finals in case we get this done and do well in the upcoming tasks(with having a score of 0 in task 3)?"
Drone behaving randomly with different batteries	"Very Urgent Respected sir, With different batteries drone is behaving differently when ever the battery is changed.

no effect on drone through /drone_command	"Sir we are using pid to calculate the roll, pitch and yaw of the drone but the problem is that the drone just arms and then the values published on /drone_command has no effect on the drone"
Holding of Drone	"Sir,   The drone reaches the desired position then when it tries to go up even further , it comes down , which is the correct approach the drone should take but as soon as the drone receives the down command it is unable to reach up. We tested whether in the code the up command was being published or not and it is getting published but the drone doesn't go up when it goes down. We are not asking you to debug our whole code but we are stuck at this problem for quite a while now. We are not getting anywhere. Please Guide Us.  "

drone stabilze	"In order to stabilize drone at HOLD height do we require to put drone in mode 2. 1) if i put it in mode 2 will it accept values from script? 2) my script takes x milliseconds to calculate roll,pitch,yaw etc. plutonode.cpp waits for 22 milliseconds for next command. So if i change plutonode.cpp delay to x seconds then it will match with my script. Am i right ?  And now what i have to do with ""drone_command publishes every 100 milliseconds"". What is the significance of it? Can you explain the relation between x,22 milliseconds and 100 milliseconds in some detail??"
Regarding 3D printed brackets	"Sir,  Where our 3D printed brackets will be delivered? On the address provided while filling 3D printing details or to the college address as our brackets are dispatched through INDIA POST.   Also, while tracking the consignment I'd it showed no ""Consignment details not found"". Team I'd :- SS#1755"
Change in initial values due to calibration	"After multiple calibration, the error in roll and pitch can't be rectified. As a result, the drone starts moving in RIGHT due to roll when Roll=1500, BUT when algo reduces roll to1350, the drone stabilizes in Roll. Same is with the Pitch as well. Each time the error in Roll and Pitch changes and hence 1350 value also changes. When drone is on flat surface, the Roll varies from -13 to -8 . And pitch varies from 2 to 8 . # In pluto App, we can trim the values so that error in Roll and Pitch can be rectified, but in programming trimming can't be done without knowing the relation. So during tuning, when error in coordinates is zero, output does not affect the 1500, but drone shows a very sensitive motion still then in Roll and Pitch. I have given too much time to make things work,but now need some advice how to proceed. Adding more details,in this question. Below is the screen shot of values received from drone when drone is placed on floor:   "

change in motor rpm	Sir the motor is showing random behaviour due to difference in rpm of motors. Initially the motors were working fine and now drone is unable to attain heightPlease help
drone disarming	My script is able to take off the drone to HOLD height but after that drone suddenly disarms and drops down. Sometimes even before reaching to HOLD height it disarms itself. I have checked rcThrottle value published by my script and it is fine. Why it automatically disarms itself?
drone not increasing in height	"Hi, Our drone too didn't go above certain height. It actually flew well during the first few days but not now (maybe due to unavoidable crashes). So, we tried removing propeller guards as it was kind of loose and the drone actually worked well. So, the problem might be with the: 1. improper leveling of propeller guards. They might be loose or obstructing your propellers. So try flying the drone without that (NOTE: possible damage may occur to your propellers on crash. maybe you can order them or Eyantra team may resolve them) 2. Motors may have been not placed firmly in their holder 3. Propellers may have been loose If nothing works, reassemble the entire drone again. (Our battery would discharge from 4.2 to 3.6 V drastically when flying the drone, but it rose to a good height. So, we don't think battery is the problem. The above tweaks may or may not work as you might have a completely different scenario)   If you can find the real root cause of this problem, please post about it.   Hope this might help you!!! All the best !!!"
Behaviour of Drone	"SIr,   Team Id: #5457   Even at full charged battery when we give a throttle value, it goes up but in backward direction and then even when the code is sending the command to go right it doesn't go, it just goes up around 10-15cm and then rushes backward. We thought it was due to motors so we replaced the motors but the problem persisted then we replaced the propellers but this also didn't solve it. We calibrated it multiple times with different phones but still the problem persisted. Each time the calibrated values were good the pitch was 0 roll was 0 and yaw was around 3.   We have also checked with the script you provided the when we press 'w' the drone goes up around 10cm and then rushes backward.   One thing we noticed is that when we did the motor test the drone circled in one direction. The link of the video showing our problem. https://youtu.be/tYdcr-dyfmg"
VERY URGENT : New Batteries also not working	"I have received the new batteries but in Pluto App it is still showing 0Vs and with old batteries it is showing 0.1Vs in app. Is there any problem with the drone board???I charged all the batteries and then tried them ,the above voltage readings are after fully charging the batteries"
Battery Replacement	"Have the batteries been dispatched?. If so, Please let us know the tracking ID. We have to inform our college about it. Team ID-CD#916"
doubts	"1) Do we also need to tune drone's internal pid in advanced settings of plutoapp because it resists our values,specially the altitude? 2) Whycon many times fails to detect drone in motion when speed is a little high, by which the drone continues to go in that direction, how do we fix this? Also when drone is at rest,whycon values are not constant, it varies +-1 in z direction and +-0.5 in y and +-0.3 in x direction, is this normal? 3) What does the value 22ms corresponds to in plutonode, what will increasing it will do? 4) if we publish at a faster rate, will all that go in queue and the new values will take time to reach the drone?"
Can we change base value	Sir I tried 1500 as base value but it was moving one direction. If I change the base value it moves in opp direction. Sir what to do for the drone to stand still after taking off. Does centre of gravity play a role?
Drone doesn't go above few cms	" Hi, The drone does not take off even after controlling with the app. It just stays in the ground even though the propellers are rotating. We checked for proper alignment of propellers (diagonal same) and used fully charged battery, yet it does not rise above 1 cm. We tried updating the firmware but the problem still persists. However,  sometimes, it just works all of a sudden and gives us false hope. We don't think battery is the problem because it shows 4.2 to 3.7 V. Moreover, the yaw calibration is required often. Please resolve our issues and let us know what might be the actual problem so that we can correct it. We've attached link to the throttle problem: https://youtu.be/V9Ge-klgHO0 Thanks in advance!   Team Id - #1712"
Regarding command delay	"1. Sir, if my code publishes the command at every 33 milliseconds but drone_command publishes at 100 milliseconds then what will happen ?? Does some of the commands get lost ??   2. Also, please tell us the rate at which drone_command topic publishes the command ??"
regarding yaw value	"when i gave only yaw value as 1600 or 1400 maintaining roll,pitch and throttle at 1500 drone has to rotate in it's position only but it starts moving in random position what is the reason for this and solution also..."
Diffuculties in PID tuning	"Sir since a long time we have been working hard to PID tune our drone but we are facing the following difficulties:We made a code such that  PID* constant value is added or subtracted from 1500 to get the desired result One major issue is that this constant value is changing for different axis and for different quadrantsWe have also tried using different constant values for different axis and tuned the drone for each axis at a time.But everytime we change the battery the values would change again and we tested it innumerable times. But the drone does not hold in its position and shows random behaviour. We really want some hint as to where we are going wrong, as we have tried all ways possible, used rqt plots, made observations, run-time values for Kp, Ki, Kd. We are unable to find any solution.Need some help...."
x y direction roll and pitch	"http://wiki.ros.org/pluto_drone says that in order to go in x axes increase roll but key_handling.py increases pitch to do that.   1)What is x axis with respect to drone? 2)Can you specify relation of rcRoll and rcPitch with x and y axis?

rcAUX values	"http://wiki.ros.org/pluto_drone sets the rcAUX1,rcAUX1,rcAUX1 to 0. But key_handling.py sets it to 1500. Can you tell about the significance of rcAUX{1,2,3,4} . I am not getting how to use them. do they specify any modes ?"
Drone not arming always	"Dear Sir,   Our drone is not getting armed everytime as required.Its arming sometimes only and also as soon as we change the battery its not arming.Whenever it arms, the yaw is not maintained properly.Since the whycon marker doesnt give any info about yaw , we are unable to maintain yaw due to which our pid is going wrong.   Please help us!!!!!!!!!!"

Very urgent:Altitude not holding at 1500rpm	Our drone doesn't float at a particular rpm 1500. It's my humble request competitors please don't answer my question
Failure in performing Task - 3	"Respected sir,Although we tried our best, we were not able to do the Task-3 in the given time. Now its past the deadline so I want to sumarise all the problems that we faced while doing the task so that atleast we can get to know where we went wrong and what was the best way to approach the problem. -> We were easily able to maneuver the drone through python code since the begining. Our hard coded version of code armed, disarmed, made the drone reach hieght and move in various directions easily.-> So our next step was to apply the PID algorithm. # Observations:1. The maximum error we were getting in any case was [-8,8]2. So, the value of the derivator term was always in between [-8,8] in any case3. For starting the PID tuning we avoided taking in the Integral part ( as it is summission of all the errors upto a given point) which usually came out to be very large.4. So PID = P*error + D*derivator -> Now I started tuning with an initial value of P=0.4 and D=0.7, which I had used for tuning of my virtual drone-> The resultant PID came out in the range of (-5, 5)-> But the values we required for motion of drone should be in between [1000, 2000]-> So I made an equation such that -> [output sent to the motor] = 1500 (+/-) PID*(some constant value -> A) -> So now we observed that this value A varied for different axis and for different quadrants :  For eg A required was different for +x axis and -ve x axis. So I coded it as such, so as to provide differnt A values for different axis' and different quadrants So we started tuning our drone for one axis at a time But while determining the perfect value of this A the battery usually discharged and once we changed the battery the values of A changed So everytime we changed the battery we would tune the drone just again -> determined the value of A again for all the axis anew( and these values were always different -> so we assumed that changing the battery effected the value of A) So after tuning the drone in each axis for a given battery we would run our code for combined value( for both x and y) for the drone to reach the setpoint And drone did usually reached its setpoint But when we enhanced the code for HOLDING, the drone would not hold.. it would start oscillating and sometimes exbhited random behaviour But usually uptill this point, the battery would discharge and we repeated the process again for a new battery -> We persisted the same thing for a few days without any result -> Then on one of the run we observed that the values of A were changing according to the point where we tune it from, i.e,  If we are tuning the drone from a point which is near to the setpoint then the value of A required was high while if the tuning of A was done from a far point then the value of would be less.-> Thus the observation was made that when point is quite far from the set point ( the error was large..... thus PID value is large for this point ) so from here drone requires a comparitively lesser speed to stably reach the set point....... while when point was close to setpoint the PID value was not large enough to make the drone reach the setpoint so the value of A required here was larger.  So now we were required to modify the code as such.....  so lets take the case of +ve x axis -> for this -> output = 1600 - PID value -> so now when PID value was small the drone got higher magnitude for motion while for far away points the PID value would be large and thus would move slowly and stably to destination. -> This strategy worked but only for half of the plane......... and lots ambiguities existed.  Resultantly now the drone was not even reaching the setpoint properly let alone HOLDING there. In the whole case we also worked for varied values of P and D, used rqt_plot for ensuring fine tuning and researched a lot abot PID tuning of a drone but without any fruit And discharging of drone batteries in just 2 - 3 minutes was a major issue  So the whole process was very tiresome and fruitless as finally we were not able to submit any video. We worked really hard for this task  So through this post I just expect a few remarks as to what was the correct way to perform the task as we are sure that we missed a very important point Team ID: eYRC#582"
Drone receives only the first published command (Team ID:5815)	"Dear Sir, when i am using the key_command file provided by you then the drone responds to all the actions as given by us, however when i use my script to give commands to the drone by manually feeding values to the /input_key topic, the drone receives only the first command published. I have tried a lot but still didn't find any solution to this. I request you to kindly help us out as soon as possible.   for example, in the above picture the moment i remove the comment tag from the highlighted lines, the drone only works for arming and doesn't disarm after 4 secs, however if i keep those lines commented, the drone responds to all the commands when i press a or d or whichever key.   Sir we are stuck at this point for a lot of time and can't proceed further. Our PID algorithm is ready but it's of no use until we are able to send commands to the drone. I request you to kindly answer this as soon as possible. Thank you,"
Regarding Penalty applied in Task3	I understand that the penalty for task 3 is system generated. But can you please let us know what the penalty is depending on the date we submit the task?
Drone not able to take_off	"Dear Instructor,   We have been trying to fly the drone but even at 4.2 V battery it doesn't take off. We have tested it with the app and at full throttle also it is not able to increase its height. What might be the problem?   Also one of the three battery is faulty and does not start the drone at all. We have charged it fully. Please reply soon..."
Regarding Submission of Task 3	"Sir, we could not submit the task 3 by yesterday 9th Jan 2018 11:59 pm, but we did it by 10th Jan 2018 05:33:47 am.   This inadvertent delay was due to the loss of 1 week of time in getting our Spark V repaired by Nex Robotics, and some riots happening in Mumbai (causing delay in sending our bot via courier services). So we got very less time in completion of the task.      Refer to our full communication with Nex Robotics- @1496   Kindly cooperate with us and debar us from the penalties. Looking forward for a positive reply.   Team eYRC #CB144"
Regarding selection for final event which is going to be held at IIT Bombay	We had penalty in Task 1.2 as well as due to internet connection problem we submitted the task 3 at 12:03 am and thus we will again face penalty.We have more than one team selected in our theme and they didn't face any penalty.So will the Task 4 be only considered or the total of all the task will be considered for selection for the final event ?
White line sensor	"Sir the right white line sensor in the sparkV is not working properly. When I place the sparkV on black paper left and center sensor are giving value around 190 out of 255, but right sensor is giving value around 120. We have adjusted the potentiometer but still the problem remains. Though we have some how adjusted the reading so that it mapping the value around 120 to 190 and our sparkV is working properly, but if you can give a solution about it , it will be very helpful."
Regarding Task 2	"Sir, We had submitted our task 2 but in Task Result the remarks show that we have not submitted it. Kindly, go through this matter. Team id: - SS#1755"

unable to open saved video	"Sir, we are clear with the tasks but are unable to open the recorded video (input_video.avi) as instructed in the instruction pdfs.We tried configuring ffmpeg as shown here and we still couldn't get the video to open. We even did a full, clean remake/installation of opencv and the problem persisted. We reconfigured ffmpeg as shown here, still no success. The video is saved in the same folder as the python script and we are using the cv2.VideoCapture(filename) and cap.isOpened() functions followed by cv2.imshow().Trying with cv2.VideoCapture(os.path.join(filename)) also results in failure.   We are able to set the position and orientation of the truck using APIs and given a specific image, it works fine. But python fails to open the video saved locally. Please guide."
We haven't tuned pid but completed think and answer.	Can we submit this think and answer alone before tonight (9/1/2018) 11.59pm? Can you pls award marks for it without penalizing?   We will submit the video tomorrow.
Picture of Full Arena	Does the Final Arena image to be included in the Doc need to contain a shot of the Over Head Cam We have attached the USB Can to the ceiling so it's not quite possible to get the Cam and Arena together in the same shot   So if we only attach images of the Arena would that be Ok ?
Size of the Zip	"Sir, our zip file is around 15.8 mb, even after compressing the videos. Is the file size ok? or should we reduce the size still?   It got uploaded in portal, should we try to reduce still and reupload or is this ok?"
query related to emulation	Our robot is shaking to much while following the path..   video link:: https://youtu.be/3414igd3dno
Regarding newly shipped batteries	Centre of mass is shifted due to difference in weight/size of the new battery. Hence the drone wobbles.
Drone doesn't go above a certain height even after charging the battery	"Our drone goes above a height of 30 cm only for about 5 seconds on full charge, after that it starts to fall off and doesn't even go above 20 cm. This is by using the phone application and giving full throttle. Because of this we are unable to tweak the PID algorithm properly. This happens for all the batteries. What should we do?"
Problem in setOrientation	"When I change the orientation. The wheels are standing as such and the everything else are rotating. How to solve this ?Also in my scene, the reference dummies and lua functions weren't there. I created those.   We can change the floor size to 10 m right ?"
Regarding submission of task	is 9/1/2018 the final deadline for submitting the task or can can submit tomorrow with penalty?
Shipping back of SparkV robot to nex robotics	"Dear Admin,   We are going to upload the testing video of the drone but will be unable to upload the same for the SparkV robot.   Nex robotics has asked us to ship the SparkV robot back. They said they will fix it. This entire procedure is expected to take a week.   Please give us extra time to upload the hardware testing video for the SparkV robot.   Team id :eYRC#83"
Regarding time in PID loop	"Sir, from receiving the coordinate of drone's marker to publishing the new coordinate ( after calculating PID Output) my code is taking 90 microseconds. Is it the reason for my drone's unexpected behaviour ?? Please answer........thanks !"
Task 3 zip File way beyond 15MB size	The input_video.avi that we recorded using save_video.py is large in size (183 MB) and we also have to include the task3_2.mp4 which wil also have a decent size. But the Read me.pdf states that the upload folder for Task 3 should be less than 15 MB in size.    Should we upload the Task3_2.mp4 video and  the input_video.avi to Google Drive and share the link with e-Yantra?   Kindly solve this issue as soon as possible!      
Regarding Submission	"Total size of upload folder is 96.8 MB. it can't be converted in less than 15MB. what can we do for that? if compresses both the video than quality of video may be decrease, is it ok? it may be also caused problem in emulation."
Doubt regarding scoring system	   Is the (WP*500) an error ? As it is a very high weightage. We need to know this to answer question Q6 of the think and answer.

URGENT- PLEASE EXTEND THE DEADLINE	"Sir, we are working very hard for this theme, but we could not do in this hard time deadline. We came across so far on the way and we are ready for more challenges. But would not be possible in such short period. Please accept our request for the extension of Deadline for Task 3 Chaser Drone.  A little time can change someone faith."
Drone issues	"Sir initially the drone was able to takeoff and stabilise at the give no coordinate of z axiss for some time but now evening with the same script the drone isnt even taking off. And for the z axis, PID using whycon coordinates is better or with altitude? We are currently using whycon coordinates. Along with all this the batteries die off very soon. we arent able to figure out what is exactly going wrong and How to fix it."
about task 3 deadline	"Dear Instructor, we have already uploaded the hardware testing video. when we  try to control the drone to lift, its takes it in different direction     of   arms   using script.     sir today is  the deadline for TAsk-3...?"
regarding joystick hardware design question	Q1. Is internal structure or working of analog joystick expected in the question: Explain the hardware and software used for construction of joystick?   Q2. We have interpreted the meaning of inputs taken from joystick after the transmission i.e. in snake robot.  In which question we should include this information about interpretation? in software construction of joystick or  in information exchange between joystick and snake.   last two questions are confusing us. Can you please provide comparison between these two questions? it will be better for us to understand questions clearly before answering.  
Theme Analysis and Implementation	Q.2 requires a pic of the entire arena with the over head Camera  We haven't made a stick we have just placed the camera on the ceiling so it's not quite possible for us to get the overhead camera in the shot   Can we just place a picture of the arena with the fruits and no overhead camera 
Regarding Emulation	"Do we need to place the fruits also in the emulation ? The document only says about the references and the truck. SO is it enough that we position references and then move the truck within that area, ?"
Unable to tune drone for roll and pitch	"Sir, depending on the battery conditions, the pid for roll and pitch is acting differently and it's very difficult to tune it. A battery lasts for 1 min and every time the battery is changed the drone responds differently. The drone stands at a position for some time and as soon as the battery voltage drops a bit, the drone goes out of th position and falls down. Please help. Thank you."
Regarding printing of values on the sensor values on the lcd of spark V	"Sir, we uploaded the spark_V testing.hex file and it is not printing anything on the screen, the screen is just blank. What should we do?"

Y coordinate varies along Z axis	"Hi sir !  The y coordinate varies along the z axis. That is the y coordinate is at one value on the ground and as the height increases, the y value also changes. We have calibrated the camera almost 5 times and we've calibrated the drone also. The camera is fixed on the ceiling and it is perfectly parallel to the ground. What might the problem be ? Due to this, we are unable to tune PID. Please help us asap. Is there any other way out of this ? "
Compressing video	"Sir,we got correct output before compressing the video,but after compression we are getting the error as shown in image below."
Please arrange for an hangout session	Drone not taking off properly! Suddenly it is rotating! Our morale is very low. But we want to explore and learn more. We are yearning for an chance. Please help us!
URGENT - PLUTO DRONE PROBLEM	"Sir, I am controlling the drone from PlutoApp and the drone is not responding to change in roll and pitch. It arms and when i give throttle instead of going directly up it only takes a height of 3-4 cm and then start pitching forward even when i am not changing pitch. Also joystick in PlutoApp for roll and pitch has no effect on drone. Please reply asap!"
error with white line sensor [urgent]	we tried every measure but there is some problem with the left white line sensor. while doing the line follower code the left white line sensor is giving bizarre values.   kindly help this as tomorrow is the submission.

Confusion regarding submission?	Which files do we have to submitted plz mentioned there appropriate files name?
Video got recorded as upside down.	   Is it okay if the video got recorded upside down?
Drone stops receiving commands in between.	Drone stops receiving commands at random instances causing to lose control and crash. There is no Wi-Fi disconnection. Our script is sending the values to the drone in a loop continuously.(similar to the one in key_handling.py) This issue is not faced when using the App. What could be the problem?
Are we allowed to divide up the single python file into many files for ease of use?	It is mentioned that we upload only one file namely task3_cb.py but I feel that copy pasting all that code into one file would be ugly. So can I instead upload  task3_cb.py  + some additional .py files 
TASK_3 Submission date	"Sir    Since 4/01/2018 my drone WiFi is not working, So I am not able to do anything. I have placed a  query regarding the same on that day but only on 7/01/2018, I received a reply. As the board is being shipped today, so I am expected to receive it after 10/01/2018. This is link to my previous post:  https://piazza.com/class/j945dzm64wa3km?cid=1752  Considering the problem, kindly extend the submission date of task_3 for me. Thank you.        "
About the given hex files	Can we get the source code for the hex files given to us? Or is this asking too much? XD
Task 3 submission deadline to be extended	"Sir , we are very enthusiastic about this project. We have already tested the black line follower. But regarding the video to be submitted we are unable to record as our college is closed till 10th. Our flex sheet is in the college and we are not able to record the video. We will do it as soon as our college opens. Can you please help us by extending the deadline. It will be very helpful. "
Drone battery	"The drone works fine for a voltage of 4.2 with the set gains but the voltage starts dropping its behavior also changes and once it goes below 4 it does not take off only to a significant height and all these happens within 5-6 trials of tuning only, what is the solution to this problem? Also what is the hovering throttle range for pluto drone? "
Doubts regearding sensor values	"Sir, I have doubts regarding the sensor values.   1. To maneuver the drone in x,y,z directions, we are using the rcThrottle, rcRoll and rcPitch. But I am not getting where to use the sensor values (roll,pitch,yaw and altitude)   2. The battery of drone stays only for a min and the altitude of the drone falls down immediately after 1 min.   Thank you  "
Drone doesn't takeoff using script	"Sir, the drone doesn't arm itself even when we fire the arm() command repeatedly in the key_handling.py script. Please hint us on where we are going wrong ASAP and whether there is any other way to do this."
Regarding Servo connection to Nano	"Sir,  If we are using 10 servos for the entire snake, can we connect it's data pins to 1 Nano(since It has only 6 PWM pins). Can we use software Pwm? SS#13"
Problem in emulation	"We have used simResetDynamicObject and simGetObjectsInTree before every change in movement, however our bot is shaking too much and is the movement is not at all smooth, is there a way to fix it? Also is it ok to change position and orientation in lua functions or we need to do it in python?"
Regarding Arena	"1.Can we end the race at any position on the arena?As there is no as such end zone or we'll have to go to the Start Zone? 2.The arena includes only the green part or it also includes the numbers and the alphabets used for positioning the hurdles, ramps,etc? As, in the arena provided in the Task4 we can see a hurdle with position A7,A9 is such that the bot will be out of the arena while it crosses it if only green part is the arena."
Coverage of arena	If the arena looks trapezoidal due to tilted angle of camera and if we code it to get correct position and orientation in the simulation. Is it fine?
regarding question 4 in task 4	"In the part of question 4: ""several challenges faced while designing the physical structure in fusion 360 "" should we lay more emphasis on challenges faced while designing the structure or on the problems in the interface of software ?"
Delay Function is not working	"In our task, we are supposed to stop SparkV at Station Center 5 for 10 seconds, for that we used : _delay_ms(10000);   But it is not working, is there any other way to do this ?"
Video Recording for Emulation (input video)	"Hey, we successfully recorded the video using save_video.py. Although, as we are having exams so it wouldn't have been possible for us to record it later so we did in low light conditions outdoors in the evening. ArUco markers are getting perfectly recognized but as we used flashlight and bulbs near every corners for proper lighting and detection. On one corner (near station 6), slight reflection is visible in video in the beginning but that is fixed. Is it okay?   Also, video recording is a bit faster than the actual, robot is actually waiting for 10 seconds but when the video is being saved, it is only 8.1 seconds. "
regarding perfect run	Sirwhat is the definition of perfect run ?Is it just detecting ALL the rodents correctly or is it just when the snake transverses the whole arena without incurring any penalties ?
regarding ec components	"Except battery , can we use more quantity of other ec components or other ec components than given in the kit?"

Spotter snake	Will the sound intensity produced by the buzzer when supplied with 5V suffice or do we need to use a higher voltage??
Help regarding Drone motion	"Sir,   team id #5457   In the video provided showing the whycon localization by you while taking off the drone moves up without changing it's yaw, but when we tried our algorithm to localize it ,it moves up but due to unwanted yaw it changes its direction and the relative axis changes, we are not able to understand how to prevent it, in a previous post given by another team you said to map the values, what do you mean by it?   And also what value did you take for rcThrottle , in the script you provided us it was 1600 but it was not lifting up but at 1800 and above its working. So is this the correct value to take?   Please Help Us   Thank You"
WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION	"Lipo battery is having more weight than other components ie servo+bracket weight. So we r facing difficulty in weight distribution,  can the robot be powered by wires keeping battery outside the bot??? "
PLEASE ANSWER THIS	@1750
Video captured by save_video.py is always zoomed in?	"Compared to other webcam Apps, the  video captured by save_video.py is always zoomed in. Is there any python functions, such that it captures video without zoomed. So, that it will be easy to decrease camera height."
Powering Transmitter circuit	Can we use external battery source for transmitter or should we power it via laptop only?

Unable to increase height or move the drone	"Sir,   We've tried everything to make the drone move after arming. But it does'nt work in the automatic mode. The provided script works. We put everything required in a single script including arming and control together, But it does'nt take off. Should we include a sleep in between (but it does'nt seem to be influencing much when we tried doing that). What is the mistake? Please do help"
reposition rules	"sir, during reposition, after placing the snake in start zone, does it have to resume its motion with 5 beeps which it did at the start of time ?"
orientation of drone	can we use mavros to get orientation?
Drone rotates automatically	"Sir, As soon as we arm the drone, it rotates automatically and changes its orientation in random direction. So our PID algo doesnt work. What should be done to not rotate it? Will it be done by maintaining the yaw ? How will we access the orientation components Ox,Oy,Oz using rosservice?  "
regarding positioning of snake in start zone while repositioning	"Sir,  during repositioning of the snake, should the snake once again be completely inside the start zone?"

Throttle not responding after giving pitch	"Sir     First we gave the throttle value as 1500. Then gave pitch value to move forward and backward and these values are working perfectly fine. But again after the pitch, if I increase the throttle value to 2000, the drone is not responding!!what might be the problem? Thanks in advance"
Altitude issues	"Sir     First we gave the throttle value as 1500. Then gave pitch value to move forward and backward and these values are working perfectly fine. But again after the pitch, if I increase the throttle value to 2000, the drone is not responding!!what might be the problem? Thanks in advance"

regarding re entry in start zone	when we have started the robot and  while it's transversing the arena can it re enter the start zone or entry is not allowed after starting it ?
Throttle doubt	Hello sir! I can't understand throttle mechanism.Please provide me the details so i can proceed further.I already searched in Google and it's not sufficient! Please tell me how throttle affects the drone lift mechanisms in pluto drone
Delay	Hello sir! Should i give delay time before publishing throttle pitch yaw roll values?
Regarding Rulebook	"SirIn the rulebook a statement is mentioned that "" If the snake is found damaging the arena, it will be immediately stopped .""In this what does the line damaging the arena means ?Aren't the ramp and hurdles rigidly fixed to the arena ?"
Regarding Frame Rate	"Dear Instructor,   1. In emulation task, the frame rate we are getting is around 27 fps and because of that the recorded video is playing a little slower than its actual speed. Due to this, the robot seems to stop at station 5 for more than 10 seconds but in reality it stops for 10 seconds. As a result  the truck in emulation stops for more than 10 seconds too.   Is this fine or we need to increase frame rate?     2. Also we are using .mp4 video file. Is that ok or we should switch to .avi?   We have converted our file to .avi from .mp4 and now we are getting ~27 fps(earlier 22fps in case of .mp4 file). Still the robot seems to stop for nearly 11.8 seconds(previously 15-16 seconds in case of .mp4 format) in the video."
Unable to stop the stream: Inappropriate ioctl for device	"Sir,   We have been facing this issue while reading input_video.avi file   On executing python script, we get this message in terminal : ""Unable to stop the stream: Inappropriate ioctl for device""   I googled this and performed some steps but still no luck.   I have referred to @489 and performed all those steps, but still its not working. Is there any other way to do this so that we can proceed further."
Clarification about drone motion	"Sir,     We did the following points:    1. First we gave a throttle value of 2000 and then reduced to 1700 to make the drone float at a point(at 1500 drone is not floating, so we increased to 1700). All other initial values are 1500.    2. Then we increased the pitch value to 1600 to make it move forward. And then made it 1400 to move backward. For this kind of operation what is the expected motion of the drone? Is it necessary that the throttle value should be made 1500 in order to vary the pitch and roll?? Are we making mistakes in giving the values for throttle? We are not able to get a clear idea and not able to proceed with pid. please help with this. Thanks in advance            "

Do we have to make changes to the black line following hex file so that it stops at station 5 while moving from 4 to 6.. in actual arena? or in actual arena  the spark v must move from station 4 to 6 without stopping and in vrep we have to emulate such that just during simulation it stops at station 5 for 10s?
Urgent: Drone Battery Problem	"Sir #1140 We've been able to apply PID in z-axis and the drone was fairly stable till yesterday.   1. Today we're facing a problem that one of the batteries is not charging and after the LED of charger goes off, it only shows a value of 0.62V in the multimeter. Even the battery is not able to start the Wi-Fi of the drone.   2. Other two batteries are not properly functional. They work only for few seconds and after full charge we are able to fly it only for 20-30 secs using the PlutoController app. In starting the drone goes to some fair height with the other 2 batteries but after 20-30 sec the height decreases to about 10-15 cm. Sir, please respond as soon as possible. "
drone board not working properly	"sir, In pluto app it is constantly showing low battery but the battery is fully charged, i have tried all the batteries  and on running the script it is giving the error that is in attached image.

"      Camera, PID and Reset."	"Sir, 1) When Drone is in motion for a some time camera stop detecting the co-ordinates of marker on Drone and due to that its starts moving randomly.      Is it happening due to lights intensity in room? 2)  Do we have apply PID for x,y,z in same function or separately? Because on applying PID in X and Y with 1500 +- 100(approx) its showing a random motion.      and On applying PID only in Z there is also some movements in X and Y axis tough roll and pitch is given 1500(exact). 3)  On moving to some Z position and calling reset function the drone shows some random motion.       Reset fun(): roll = 1500 , pitch =1500 , yaw =1500, throttle=1500.       Is reset function is used to stabilize drone in current position?    "
About finding orientation of spark v	"We have tried to set orientation of TRUCK using simSetObjectOrientation() but this function accepts orientation in form of euler angles. So how can we get euler angles from angle in degree. Or We have to set orientation in other way? then, Please suggest us."
Additional ArUco Markers	Are we allowed to use some additional ArUco markers in designing our solution?
Regarding the construction of arena.	The rule book specifies us to use sun board for sticking the aruco markers. No retailer in and around our area has sunboards. Shall we proceed with cardboard instead?

Final Results	"Dear Participants,   eYRC-2017 final task (Task 4: video and code) results have been announced.  Please check the portal to know the same. Please note that this decision is final and no requests about the same will be taken into consideration.   All the best!! #pin"
Kindly Note	"Greetings from e-Yantra!     Dear Participants,   The competition closes on 26th February, 11:59 PM.   Hence, teams who had downloaded their Original configuration well before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM can still submit their task before the competition closes with penalty as per the policy on portal.   Teams who downloaded the configuration just before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM have only 48 hours to submit their task. No submission for Original configuration or for Code submission will be considered (even via an email) after 26th February, 11:59 PM.   Hence, we request teams to kindly pace up their work and avoid last moment rush.   Teams should submit their Original task with Code well before the deadline, maybe by 9 or 10 PM tomorrow. Many teams try to submit their task at the last moment due to which the server gets loaded and then they aren't able to submit their task on time. So, please avoid such situations for your benefit.     You can download the Bonus configuration even with penalty or zero score on Original configuration till 26th Feb, midnight.     But, the last date to submit the video for Bonus task is 26th Feb, midnight. Though there is no penalty for Code and Bonus video submission, the submission won't be considered after 26th Feb midnight.     Thank you.    All the best !! #pin"
Task 4 Launched!	Dear Participants!   Task 4 has been launched. You can download the original configuration from the task 4 tab on portal when you are ready.   Best of luck !! #pin
Before Task 4 Release	"Dear Participants, Here are a couple of guidelines before Task 4 release.  1)  As informed earlier, Task 4 - Original Configuration will be available for download from Midnight, 22nd February, 2018 to Midnight 24th February, 2018. Once you download the Original Configuration, a countdown timer of 48 hours will start. You will have 48 hours from time of first download to submit your solution for this Original Configuration without any penalty.   2) Code Submission -  Code submission instructions will be given with Original Configuration download. You need to clean up your working code according to the ""Coding Standard"" given on portal. Code submission final deadline is Midnight, 26th February.  3) Bonus Configuration - Bonus Configuration will be available for download to teams who have submitted the video demonstration (even with penalty) for the Original Configuration. Bonus Configuration will be evaluated ONLY if you have a working solution for the Original Configuration.   You can submit the Bonus Configuration till Midnight, February 26th, 2018 when the competition closes. No extensions will be allowed. 4) Midnight, February 26th, 2018 is the hard deadline for the competition. Original, Bonus, and Code should be submitted before that.   5) Be careful of when you download the Original Configuration since it will dictate how much time you get for bonus configuration.   For example, if you download the Original on 23rd Feb at 6:00PM, you will get till 25th Feb, 6:00PM to submit without penalty. If you submit at 5:00 PM, you will get till 26th 11:59PM to submit Bonus and Code.  However, if you download the original on 24th Feb, at 11:00PM and submit it on 26th Feb 10:30 - 11:00 PM, you will get hardly enough time to shoot and submit the Bonus.   So plan accordingly. Don't download too late, or too early.  6) In the original configuration, the starting position and orientation of robots will be given along with position and colour of plants. You are allowed to initialise the starting position of robots in the code, but are not allowed to hardcode the position of plants in the code. Your robot algorithm should be dynamic enough that regardless of the starting position of robot, the run should work perfectly.  7) Don't forget the Plant colour indications using RGB led!! Before a robot fertilizes / weeds a Plant, it should indicate the color of the Plant by glowing the corresponding color on the RGB Led.  8) Make sure the lighting conditions you shoot the video are uniform. They will make a lot of difference in colour sensing.  Best of Luck !!!!       #pin"
Task 4 Release	"Dear Participants   Greeting from e-Yantra !!   Task 4 - Original Configuration will be available for download from Midnight, 22nd February, 2018 to Midnight 24th February, 2018.   Once you download the Original Configuration, a countdown timer of 48 hours will start. You will have 48 hours from time of first download to submit your solution for this Original Configuration without any penalty.   More details will be released on the portal next week. Meanwhile, please work hard to finish the theme implementation. Any requests for extension of deadline will not be entertained.   Best of Luck !! #pin"
Color Sensor Interfacing	"Since a lot of students are having problem with color sensor interfacing with Spark V, here's some more help.   As mentioned earlier you have to configure Timer Input Capture Mode to capture the pulses from the colour sensor.   Below given is a small snippet of code which will help you. But don't copy paste it blindly, understand what it does.    volatile unsigned long int pulse = 0;   // <---- volatile is important !!! unsigned long int red;       // variable to store the red pulse count unsigned long int blue;      // variable to store the blue pulse count unsigned long int green;     // variable to store the green pulse count  void color_sensor_pin_config(void) { 	DDRD  =      ;            //set PD6 as input for color sensor output 	PORTD =      ;            //Enable internal pull-up for PORTD 6 pin 	DDRC =       ;            //Initialise pins connected to S0, S1, S2, S3 as output         PORTC =      ;            // Set pins as LOW initialially }  void color_sensor_pin_interrupt_init(void) //Interrupt 0 enable { 	cli();               //Clears the global interrupt 	TIMSK= TIMSK | 0x20; // Enable input capture pin of timer 1 for color sensor 	sei();               // Enables the global interrupt }  ISR(TIMER1_CAPT_vect) { 	pulse++; //increment on receiving pulse from the color sensor }  void timer1_init2(void) { 	TCNT1H = 0x00; 	TCNT1L = 0x00; 	OCR1AH = 0x00; 	OCR1AL = 0x00; 	OCR1BH = 0x00; 	OCR1BL = 0x00; 	TCCR1A = 0x00; 	TCCR1B = 0x01; //at clock frequency 	TIMSK = 0x20; } Complete the above code and try to capture pulses from the color sensor and display it on the LCD or XCTU console. After it works, implement the logic for color detection.   A word of caution -  1) Timer 1 is being used by both color sensor and motor. Both have different initialisations. Before you the function to sense color, you must called the timer1_init2 function. After sensing is complete, reinitialise the timer 1 as per required for motor control and disable input capture mode.   #pin"
Servo Interfacing HACK	"Hey Guys,  Here is another tutorial for servo interfacing. Since a lot of students are facing trouble initilalizing the 8 bit timers for servo, here is a nifty hack you can use. Though i must warn you, its a hack so it may do the job for you but it's still important to learn how to initialize timers and stuff.   So before we start, we need to learn how the PWM signal generated for servos works. So you must be knowing the normal PWM mode for controlling speed of motors.  Here the Duty Cycle is the most important component. The Amount of power delivered to the motor(hence speed of the motor) depends on the duty cycle. In case of servo motor, it is different.  For servo motors, the length of the T_on pulse determines the angle of the servo. The T_off pulse usually has an almost constant length (varying between 10-20 ms). For example if you give a T_on pulse of 1ms, the servo will rotate to 0 degree.                      if you give a T_on pulse of 2ms, the servo will rotate to 180 degree.   So to get any angle between (0-180) degrees, you need to map the values to pulse length between 1 - 2 ms.   So now we get how the servo PWM works, we can write a code to generate a signal   void servo1_pin_config (void) { 	DDRD  =                    //making PORTD 7 pin output      <------- Fill this out yourself!! 	PORTD =                    //setting PORTD 7 pin to logic 0 <------ Fill this out yourself !! }  void servo1(int delaytime) { 	for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++) 	{ 		PORTD =                 // Make PD7 High 		delay_us(delaytime);    // T_on duration 		PORTD =                 // Make PD7 Low 		delay_ms(20);           // T_off duration 	} }    A word of caution before you use this 1) T_on pulse for servo angles 0-180 varies from servo to servo. You need to calibrate it specifically for the servo you are using. 2) While the for loop is running, your robot will not be able to do anything else. It does not run the servo parallely with the microcontroller like the timer initialisation does. 3) This is not advisable for actuating the servos in robotic arms which carry load. The reason being that while the for loop is running, the servo is actuated to the specific angle. But once the loop is completed the servo becomes free. Which means it will not be able to hold that position if an external force or torque is applied on it. So it will be not able to hold a load.               #pin"
XBee Interfacing	"Since it has been evident that many students are having problems with XBee interfacing, there's some more information about this. XBee acts as a wireless UART link between two microcontrollers or a microcontroller and a PC. As I told a lot of people during the review sessions, the first step is to configure the XBees properly.   Follow the XBee Configuration tutorial to configure the XBees properly. Ideally, you would want to configure the XBees to 9600 bps. You can choose other baud rates as well, its your own discretion.   Next you will need to read more about Serial Communication. Read in detail from Spark V Software Manual and try to understand the function of all Registers.   Below given is a small snippet of code which will help you. But don't copy paste it blindly, understand what it does.    volatile char data;       //   <--------------   Volatile is very important!!! #define TE  (1<<5)  void uart_init()          // Don't forget to call this function!! { 	UCSRB = 0x00;                     //disable while setting baud rate         UCSRA = 0x00; 	UCSRC = 0x86; 	UBRRL = 0x2F;         // Set according to baud rate!! 	UBRRH = 0x00;          	UCSRB = 0x98;			  //enabling receiver and transmit }  void uart_tx(char data) { 	while(!(UCSRA & TE));			//waiting to transmit 	UDR = data; }  ISR(USART_RXC_vect)  {     data = UDR; } Go through the code and try to transmit and receive data from your XCTU console to robot. #pin"
Regarding Review Sessions	"Dear Participants,   This announcement is for all those teams who are yet to attend a review session.   During the two days of review session (22nd and 23rd), it came to our notice that a lot of teams have been claiming that they have accomplished this and that, but they had nothing to show us (even though it was told to have a small demo in    Please note that the reason why we are holding these Progress Review sessions are because we want to judge the progress the students have made in the last couple of weeks. Based on that, we will be able to give you helpful hints and suggestions. If you have nothing to demonstrate during the progress review, you will be wasting your own as well the instructors time.   This is a competition where everyone is supposed to work hard. You cannot expect to do well by working on the last day (Even if that worked till now, trust me it won't later).   So it is advisable to have a demo ready before coming for review.   Cheers ! #pin"
Review Session for Feeder-Weeder	"Dear Participants   Greetings from e-Yantra !!   We hope that your theme implementation is going well.

Hints and Tips for Interfacing Hardware (with Spark V and Firebird V)	"Dear Participants, The following are some hints and tips for interfacing hardware with the robots.   Color Sensor For interfacing color sensor with spark V you will need to access additional GPIO (To connect S0, S1, S2 and S3). You can remove the LCD from the Spark V robot and use the pins for interfacing the color sensor.Read about Timer Input Capture Mode in Atmega 16 to interface color sensor with Atmega 16Use the same color paper for covering the Plants as the sample provided to you. Many teams in Task 2 have used other shades of color paper which will be a pain for thresholding.Test your color sensor for different distance ranges and apply thresholding accordingly. The pulse count varies drastically aas the distance changes. Sharp Sensor For interfacing the sharp sensor with Spark V, use the slot provided for ultrasonic sensors on the Spark V. Read the Spark V hardware manual details.You need to enable the ultrasonic sensor slot by changing the jumper first before interfacing. XBee Instructions to configure XBee in AT Mode have been given in the Hardware Testing Folder.For the Zigbee firmware we are using (802.15.4) , there are only two modes for Zigbee Configuration (Coordinator /End Point). Configuring all XBees in network as End Point will work fine for communication. It is not necessary that one of them needs to be configured as Coordinator.You can use any other Zigbee firmware or mode as well if you want.Go through the Experiments folder at http://elsi.e-yantra.org/resources to study the Zigbee example codeXBee acts a wireless UART link once properly configured so read in detail about UART communicationThe Firebird has 4 UART ports out of which XBee is connected on UART0 portSpark V has only one UART port. So XBee and USB are multiplexed out of the same port. You need to switch the USB-Xbee jumper to switch between modes. Servo You need to study about timers and PWM to find out how to interface servos.There is a slot already provided for Servo connection on Spark V. Read the manuals and datasheet to know the timers it is connected to and how to configure the timerFor the Spark V, it is recommended you only drive micro servo using the robot since the Standard servo draws a lot of current which cannot be supplied by the Spark V battery. White Line Following Apply proper thresholding for each of the white line sensor.You can adjust the intensity of red led using the potentiometer provided.   Will add more to this section as I think of them. #pin"
Regarding Color Sensor	"Dear Participants,   If any of your color sensor or all of your color sensor seems to be faulty, then kindly send us a video of the testing. The video testing must show us the pin connections of the respective pins as well. Many teams are just showing us the LCD of the bot with different colored papers. But if your connections are not proper, then also you'll not be able to see the proper reading.   So please post the video, with the above mentioned points into consideration.   All of you must post your team id and number of sensors seeming faulty. #pin"
Tagging Nex_Robotics	"Dear Participants,   Don't tag Nex Robotics for any issues other than faulty hardware.   For any other information, tag the feederweeder only. #pin"
Burning Bootloader and other Hex Files using STK Programmer	"Dear Participants,   If you are facing trouble uploading code to Firebird/Spark V using AVR bootloader, you could try using the STK Programmer to burn the bootloader to your robot.   Download the following files and extract to your desktop  AVRDUDE_SparkV.zip AVRDUDE_ATMEGA2560.zip   Now connect the STK with robot and switch it on.   After opening command prompt go to the AVR folder extracted on desktop. cd Desktop/AVRDUDE_SparkV  After going to AVR folder path write below command stkrun bootloader.a90  then Final path will be like, C:\Users\eyantra\Desktop\AVRDUDE_SparkV>stkrun bootloader.a90  Now the boot loader has been burned in your robot, to burn hex file you can use AVR Bootloader.

Regarding Test Suite Error	"Many teams are facing the problem where they claim that their MazeSolve Project is working fine for individual test cases but fails when they run the Test Suite   One of the most common errors teams are doing is that they have declared 'i' as global/ const/ static somewhere in their src.c code, due to which their is a conflict with the loop counter in the Test Suite code. if you have done something like this int i; for( i = 0; i < 5; i++)   If you setup the C99 compiler as instructed, this wouldn't be required.    If you feel that you haven't committed this error and still your code is not working correctly when run against the test suite, you can still upload the code. We will be evaluating the code thoroughly, so you won't be penalized if we find you have followed the instructions carefully. #pin"
Integer declaration inside for loop	"A lot of teams have been facing the same error during compilation of the code since C does not allow you to declare integer variables inside the for loop.   However, we are using the C99 compiler, which allows this declaration. It has been explained how to install the right compiler in much detail in the Installing and Building Codeblocks.pdf provided to you with the task documents. You need to go through that file to install codeblocks correctly.   Please note that the documents provided to you have been provided for a reason and you are required to go through them in detail. Since this is a competition, we won't be spoonfeeding you each each and everything. #pin"
Queries Regarding Obstacle Avoidance	"Dear Participants,    As the sequence of functions called are in following manner 1. ReachDestinationAvoidingNode(5,'D',6,'D') 2. ReachDestinationAvoidingNode(2,'F',2,'D') 3. ReachDestinationAvoidingNode(2,'A',2,'C')   So you can place only one obstacle at a time in the sequential manner  1. put obstacle on (6,D) while its going to (5,D) 2. put obstacle on (2,D) while its going to (2,F) 3. put obstacle on (2,C) while its going to (2,A)   So that at one time only one obstacle is on the arena. You can make the obstacle changes while the bot is on one destination node and is giving beep.   Hope this solves your queries. #pin"

eYRC 2k17 ??	"Now as the competition has come to an end.. I would like to take a moment to thank all the Instructors / Classmates for helping throughout the competition. It was our first time in Engineering Environment where we actually implemented what we had studied in academics which would have eventually rott if we weren't given this opportunity. We understood the actual importance of memory management , power management and the needful optimisation to over come them. Our Problem solving skills improved highly in this competition .. We came up with things which We never imagined we ever could. Although we weren't able to complete the task 4 due to our own mistakes , it was a great experience overall. Thank you all once again :)Looking Forward to participate again next year to learn  more new things  !!!"
Second Chance?	When we fitted our mechanisms we were met with severe failures of xbee module and sharp sensors. Apparently they were because of loose contact. We fixed it soon but not soon enough. Due to time constriction we uploaded our video with malfunctioning bots. But we have uploaded our code on time... We were able to fix them a little so that they work slightly. And come up with a slightly working implementation. Here's the youtube links to the new videos : https://youtu.be/y-i1J8iIkGQ https://youtu.be/Dikspwmp4AY We kindly request you to consider this as our submission for task 4. (Atleast with penalty...)

Regarding code submission	We can't shoot the video since communication part didn't work .. so is it necessary to upload the remaining code?
we are unable to get colour sensor input to spark v robot i.e pd6 using timer1_init2 plz  guide	 
Abt video	There is only one link available for video uploading....so should we make a single shot video of both introduction and original configuration....or we r allowed to make to seperate videos merge them and then upload it??
Clarification	"Dear Sir,   Clarification 1: Is there any rule of 48 hours from the time of original configuration download for submitting documented code as well i.e., No matter when we submit our video for original configuration (within 48 hour time period), we can submit our documented code by 26th midnight?   Clarification 2: Can we download the bonus task before submitting our documented code?   Sir, please reply as soon as possible."
Querry	During the bonus configuration only the plant position and robot position and orientation changed ryt. We are not supposed to change the code for that. Code has to be same for both the configuration ryt? 
Penalty	"Sir , Is there any penalty or any bonus points or will the task be considered incomplete if the robots are not parked at home positions at the end of the 10 minute run? Also will the CCI points be awarded if for eg a blue feeder indicates a green/red color on the rgb for a green/ red plant respectively or a similar case for other two robots?"
Movement of robot	"If we intend the robot to start from some other node so that it follows an optimised path, can we directly code in terms of movement functions to reach there from given starting position?"
Node Detection Problem	While Firebird was excellent in detecting nodes as it's white line sensors are closely apart and SparkV sensors are little far apart than Firebird V. Thus SparkV is having problems in detecting nodes on the boundary edges. What can we do??
Regarding Video submission	Can introduction video be made separately and attached to the demonstration video? Is it considered as edited video?

(ideally, it ranges from 0- ~180)    The picture attached has the two bots configured for maximum IR lights brightness. One of the bots(left) shows correct value while the right bot has damaged white line sensors.   REQUEST 1:   Our college has a few fine working spark v bots with them, however, the white line sensors are not the same as on the bots sent us by eyantra.

What should be the ISR function name (ISR or SIGNAL)? What should be the argument (UART_SIG_RECV) or (USART_SIG_RECV) or '..vect'?   Also, what should be the optimization settings in Atmel Studio? (-O0 or -O1?). We have clean built the solution, F_CPU is verified and tried everything. Please suggest what to do. Is there something else that we are missing?

Right white line sensor not working	"Sir, The right white line sensor in our robot is not functioning properly. Because of this,our robot is not able to follow the black lines. What should we do now? Team 4331"
Regarding Video Demonstration	When recording video is it okay if we keep all the obstacles in place from the beginning itself? Also our firebird V battery isn't working so can we demonstrate while powering on ac adaptor connected to an extension cable the wire will be visible in the video. Also do we need to do just shoot the demonstration or have to describe the task before shooting the demonstration ?
Switch case statements	Does switch case statements work in the robot? It doesn't seem to work for us. We just want to know if they will execute or not.
task 1b	do I need to traverse whole path in task 1b or simply we should give the path to reach destinations.. confused.. 
but?! Sirr! in task1b ...	"I know we can use any logic which is not hardcoded, but sir, say if following task 1A description our arena is a grid and once we put onstacle at the respective places it becomes the graph with the obstacle node being disconnected from the rest( every cell or the node will have the unique configuration according to the obstacle placement). This so formed unique graph can be represented using a particular 2D array, and now using this array we can ultimately find the path between two nodes say source and destination. Hence we can place all the 3 obstacles at same time. ,   So,for the funciton ReachDestinationAvoidingNode() it is not required to pass the coordinates of obstacle node as paramater(it's already been taken care at the time of defining 2D array) but only the source and destination. And this will do the work all the 3 trips.Can we go by this ?! team_id16."
Comments for Code	Are comments required in great detail for both Tasks 1A and 1B .For example for path traversing is the name of the algorithm fine or its working is also to be explained? and also what kind of comments required in the AVR code ?
TestSuite isnt working properly	"Every test case is running successfully in mazesolve.cbp(also checked with mazesolution.txt). But testsuite is alerting ""failure"" for all testcasesScreenshots of execution"
Difference in type of formal and actual parameters in Task 1B	  While programming we came across this discrepancy in the type of formal and actual parameters for the function ReachDestinationAvoidingNode.The first and third argument are expected to be characters but they are being passed as integers.Is it okay if we pass these arguments as characters in function call in main().
"      TAsk !b,buzzer"	"Dear sir, We are not able to hear buzzer after each is destination is reached . But buzzer is working fine. Is it ok to take video ?"
Keeping track of obstacles...  Task1-b	"Hello,     Is is necessary to keep tack of previous obstacles on track while the bot is making its way to the destination      The last obstacle is on 2D ...    Bot is on 2F and wants to reach 2A with obstacle on 2C   So we have 2 obstacles ( 3 infact - the first one on 6D)  or just one on 2C ( means we have to remove obstacle after bot reaches its destination) ?   Thank you.       "
Regarding maze solving.Can nodes be repeated in path?	"is it okay if we implement the function to find path such that it is not the shortest path?i.e, can the path be such that some nodes are repeated?  "

Using Task 1A files in Task 1B	Can the C files used in Task 1A be included in the Task 1B project? Or does the logic has to be written again?
Variable declaration in Task 1B	Can we declare some global variables outside the ReachDestinationAvoidingNode() function?
task 1b path	is it necessary for the bot to traverse the shortest path to the destination or  can the bot travel any path keeping in mind not to travel through the obstacle?
Use of custom algorithm for 1b	"Sir, 1)Is it compulsory to use graphs for path planning?2)I am assuming that we have only one obstacle at a time...Is that right? and in that case i want to use custom algorithm which will be generic for other test cases as well..I am using custom algorithm for path planning. It returns me shortest path avoiding obstacles as long as the there is only one obstacle at a time..."

When a question is posted on Piazza, it only needs to be answered once.  							When students post on Piazza, everyone benefits. Students like knowing that others have the same question, and when it's answered on Piazza, it's answered for everybody.   							Ask students to post their questions to Piazza instead of emailing you directly. Some instructors choose to respond to emailed questions by redirecting the students to Piazza. Others like to copy questions from emails or office hours and post them directly on the site so the answer can benefit the entire class (and save you some time!). 						 						 	    					Piazza makes it easy to post announcements to the entire class anytime. By posting announcements on Piazza, you can see any responses to the announcement all in one place rather than letting them fill your inbox.  							To post an announcement, click ""+ New Post"" and select the ""Note"" tab, which lets you create a post that does not require a response. To make the announcement to the entire class immediately, regardless of their email settings, just check the box labeled ""Send immediately to the entire class."" All members of the class will receive an email notification of the post right away. It's a great way to get important information out fast.   							 						 						 	    					Piazza's private posts make it easy to keep all instructor dialogue in one place. When creating a new post, check the box labeled ""Make this a private question."" When an instructor adds a private post, only other class instructors can view it. Look for the blue ""Private"" label in the question feed on the left.   							Students can also create private posts. When a student creates one, only that student and the class's instructors can view the post. Student-created private posts are useful for asking questions when the student is unsure whether the material may be shared with the entire class. If the post contains information that the entire class would benefit from, an instructor can always make the private post public using the menu that appears left of the question's title in the question feed.   							 						 						 	    					As soon as you've enrolled your class, let students know you're active on Piazza by adding a couple announcements.  							The first few posts are a great opportunity to share basic information about the class, like when office hours are and how you can be contacted. Many instructors also like to lay out the ground rules for posting questions and answers on Piazza.   							Add a new post by clicking ""+ New Post"" at the top of your screen and filling in the details. Select the ""Note"" tab if you're posting an announcement and don't require a response.  							 						 						 	    					Click ""Good Question"" or ""Good Answer"" to encourage students to ask questions and respond to classmates' questions.  	    					 						 						 	    					Piazza questions and answers are like Wikipedia: anyone can contribute to them. Collaboratively edited questions and answers are far easier to read and comprehend than a long thread of comments.  							The answer to each question is divided into a students' answer (for all students to edit) and an instructors' answer (for all instructors to edit). When you read a good students' answer, click ""Good Answer!"" to endorse itthis helps encourage students to answer others' questions. Plus, when students see the checkmark over the students' answer icon in the question feed, they know that that endorsed students' answer is just as good as any instructors' answer.    							Another good way to encourage students to edit the students' answer is to refine what other students have written. Anyone can view the contributions individuals made to the response by using the Question History slider that appears above the question after several edits.  							 						 						 	    					We know from experience that visual posts can communicate concepts very effectively. Embed images, attach files, and format math and code to make posts clean and easily understandable.  	    					Easily include blocks of pre-formatted code by selecting the pre button in the question editor, and include inline code snippets by selecting the tt button for teletype text. For mathematical equations, click the Fx icon to access a LaTeX editor.  							See our formatting page for more details on how to format your posts.  							 						 						 	    					Folders make it easy to filter questions by a particular assignment or topic. Classes start out and stay more organized when instructors create folders for a class before it starts. 							Specify your class's folders in your manage class page. Click the ""Manage Class"" link at the top of your screen.  							 						 						 	    					Create a hyperlink to another post by typing the ""@"" symbol followed by that post's number (e.g. @102). Find a post's number by looking in the URL, or by hovering over the arrow to the left of the question's title in the question feed.   							 						 						 	    					If you notice that a question has been asked before, mark it as a duplicate question to avoid confusion. Select the ""Mark as Duplicate"" option in the duplicate question's more menu and follow the directions. To limit the number of duplicate questions that arise, as soon as there is a significant number of posts in your class, we'll do our part to keep things organized by requiring students to search existing posts before adding their own.  	    					 						 						 	    					As an instructor, you have full editing capabilities over all class content. You can also delete posts via the more menu or question feed drop down menu. Students do not have the ability to delete posts.  							 						     				     			      		     	     	            "
