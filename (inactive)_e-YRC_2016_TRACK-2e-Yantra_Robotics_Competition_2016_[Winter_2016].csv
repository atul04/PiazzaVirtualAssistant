ixiuvhoumf2n4,Pinned,      Tips for construction of Balance Bot and Atmel Studio(With Arduino library) example,"Tips for construction
Good construction will not only make coding easy but also make your robot robust and will be able to perform tasks easily.
Loose cables are the source of failure so fix the cables tightly using cable ties and don't let them hang outside the robot body.While testing Balance Bot it will fall many times, so make structure for protection.(You can use sponge, studs at top of bot)Due to vibration and fall components will pop out, so use screws and cable-ties to hold the components.
Atmel Studio example project(with Arduino library)
In Task 3 - scheduling sub-task, lots of people are facing problem of integrating 'Arduino library' and 'scilab library'. Another problem is using Arduino library(serial, delay, millis)  with  different clock Frequency.Find the Atmel Studio project(with Arduino library and modified libraries) balance_bot_control.zip here. Use this project for your further task. Clock setting is also changed to 14745600 Hz.
 
Finally, we are giving chance to submit Task 3-scheduling sub-task (video and code) using above code till final date of submission of Task3(i.e. 17th January). But instead of the grading policy there will be penalty of 40%  and hard deadline of 17th January. So after this submission marks will be Zero. Apart from that, submission for all tasks are open till the end of Task 4 and it is recommended to submit tasks completed by you. These submission will be evaluated separately and will be considered for certificates and also in later stage.
 
But ponder on these questions while doing future tasks:
 
What do you think is the importance of sensing task for making balance bot?? Why there is need for visualizing this data(in Scilab or Arduino)?? How will you use it to debug the robot?? Why there is need for plotting pwm vs speed plot??(You can post your answers in follow up discussion)

We had already given timeline for hardware problems( see the post  @126 for hardware problems protocol). So we will not entertain any hardware related problems from now. Teams are responsible for any hardware related problem and have to solve all the hardware problems by themselves. 
So if teams have to replace hardware consider procuring equivalent hardware as you have been provided.
 
For GY-80, if it is not available, you have options for buying them separately i.e. Analog Devices ADXL345  and ST Microelectronics L3G4200D.
For Atmega2560 board, you can use any alternative development board with same microcontroller like Arduino Mega. But along with it you have to purchase adapter for connecting Xbee in Development board side.
For Xbee you can procure any S1 or S2 type available in market.
Similarly for L298 driver you can get similar module from market.
 
Always double check connections while assembling above hardware, especially power connections.

we are team no. EB3848
So we called the e-Yantra team about our issue to power the Rpi using a power bank as it is a risk to use the circuit. 
After some convincing they allowed it on ONE condition, that no other team objects to using a power bank.
Usually no one recommends using the GPIO pins to power, as its always a danger of burning the pi. Hence I ask all other finalist in the EB theme, if you're fine with it. If anyone objects we will NOT use it. Though I suggest all of us use a power bank as its much safer.

j0apwu7rcxr3q0,Week 3/12 - 3/18,      About EB Task 5 Result and Graph,"Now that the graph has been released, it says 4 teams have scored between 3001 and 4000 and 1 team between 4001 and 5000.But I am wondering how that is even possible, Correct me if I am wrong but the formula for task 5 marks isTotal Marks = Orignal Conf marks + (bonus conf marks / 3 )and the grading formula is:(600 - T) + (VS * 150) + (CC * 100) - P + B
If total number of blocks are 6 (original conf), then in an ideal scenario, consider:
T = 0VS = 6CC = 6P = 0B = 80
 
Then according to the above formula,
Score = (600 - 0) + 6*150 + 6*100 - 0 + 80 = 2180
 
 
For Bonus conf, (ideal scenario)
T = 0VS = 5CC = 5P = 0B = 80
Score = (600 - 0) + 5*150 + 5*100 - 0 + 80 = 1930
Score / 3 = 643 
 
 
For, code (ideal scenario)
Score = 50
 
 
Therefore in an ideal scenario Task 5 Score = 2180 + 643 + 50 = 2873 
 
Since we do not live in an ideal world, it is unlikely any bot completed task in 0 seconds, Can you please explain how 5 teams got these seemingly impossible marks.
Thank you.

ize0qx2yx0e27q,Week 2/19 - 2/25,      Curious case of ADC in XBee S2C modules,"As some participants were complaining about ADC values in XBee S2C module.  So I thought of testing my joystick with two Xbee modules. I made one XBee module co-ordinator and another one in AT mode. The second Xbee in AT mode was configured  with GPIO0 for one digital IO for switch, and GPIO 1 and 2 for ADC channel for joystick. I also had given 3.3 V power supply to Joystick from XBee USB adapter.
 
Observation- So main problem was that ADC channels were always showing  3FF that is full value. While searching in the internet I found that reference voltage for Xbee S2C is 1.2 V(fixed). So to bring down the 3.3 V input voltage to 1.2 V, I added the 7.5 K resistor in series with the V+ of the joystick. Than again tested the joystick output. (As resistor of joystick was found to be 4.5K)
 
After adding above resistor, output of analog channel, when joystick was at center was 0x01F4 & 0x0274. When joystick was moved in x-direction, Channel 2 value was showing values from 0x0005 to 0x03FF. Then I tried the same in y-direction and it was showing the values from 0x0010 to 0x03FF.
 
 
 
So I hope this solves this curious case of ADC of XBee.
 
P. S. For setting XBee in Coordinator and API mode and another XBee in AT mode with periodic reading of Digital IOs read the previous posts(@656, @666)  on joystick.
 
One more problem we observe is similar to post @692. Solution to this problem, is to add 220 ohms resistor between joystick GND and GND of USB Adapter. This is to make sure that voltage from joystick never goes to zero.

I have created an img of our sd card using dd and if you wish we can upload it here with the md5sum.
 
 
A few months back I installed NOOBs on one of my spare sdcards by following instructions given on: this site. And it did work, 2 months back that is, now rpi does not boot even when I insert that very sd card in it.
 
I am powering the rpi using a  2.1 A charger so I don't think power is an issue. Then I thought maybe sd card is not making proper contact with the slot, but upon careful inspection of the slot, it is unlikely to be the reason.
 
Will you please provide us a new rpi b+ if we mail the faulty one to you? It is very hard to find rpi b+ in the market as it is a 3 year old model, all we can find is rpi 3 and 2. We have completed 95% of the coding and configuration so it would be very disappointing to not be able to continue further because of a hardware failure.

The possible reason we can figure out is that the Heat Sink of the IC was in contact with the masked supply track, probably the masking of the supply track would have got removed a bit and the GND from the sink might had came in contact with the supply  leading to the short.
 
As the track blown out and there was no connectivity, hence now we have used a jumper but hadn't checked the driver for working which we will be doing tomorrow.

I followed the procedure from here to restore it. (ASSO light not blinking, always on).
 
My Modem setting is XB24C and Function Set is 802.15.4 TH.
 
However, after resetting the XBEE (Step 7 in that article), I get the following output on the XCTU window:
Getting modem type....OK
Programming modem...Lost communication with modem
Write Parameters...Failed
 
What is the right procedure to restore the XBEE firmware? 
 
PS: I changed the function set in the first place because the Coordinator AT/API, Router AT/API modes were not available in the Function Set list as shown in the video tutorial which you had posted earlier.",1/23/17,"balance_bot,general_queries"

When we gave 0 for Motor-1 and 200 for Motor-2, we found that it was motor 1 that is rotating and not motor 2
We again gave 0 for Motor-1 and -200 for Motor-2, motor 1 rotated in reverse direction and again motor 2 is at halt.
Now we gave 200 for Motor-1 and 0 for Motor-2, for this both motors didn't rotate.
Now with 200 for both the motors. Only motor 1 rotated.
 
Also for our surprise, we found that though motor-2 is not rotating, its speed and encoder values were displayed and they were varying as we rotate the motor manually. And readings of motor-1 were always 0.0 even it is rotating for others input. 
 
We have checked the connections of motors and the driver circuit, but didn't find any error when rechecked with instructions of task-1.

earlier in was a different format moreover input and output formats were diff.we changed it to match each other.
 
 
 
after these two changes our o/p was correct .

 
 
 now i tried both of these correction simultaneously and it worked out fine.
but when i tried to do only one correction at a time i failed.

There are two major causes of the issue:
The values in node1.py are altered before the result for previous value is being printed by the method Print_result.The Nodes are started in random order and so sometimes there is wrong value in variables inter_result , num3 which are published in result and so result is wrong.

As in the screen shot it is clear that the values of inter_result , num3 and op is used to computer the result. But the printed values of num1,num2,num3 and op change during printing.

2. Tak 1.2-URDF model design for submission
3.             -Creating Gazebo world and map for submission
4.             -Autonomous Navigation using map
 
You are four members so divide your works according to your ease and knowledge:
 
Team member -1 : Understand the concept of publisher and subscriber and try to complete task1.1
Team-member -2: Understand URDF model design; You can refer the provided Firebird model to understand, Copy this file and change according to task-requirement
Team member -3: Refer the tutorial given in task-0 and understand how to create a gazebo world and map: you can create the world and using existing Firebird model.
Team member -4: Use the given firebird model for navigation until other team members will design the new model. Write the final script and test it on Firebird model for autonomous navigation

So to understand these, we try to make abstract models and break complex systems into various systems. For example, we see human body as various systems like Circulatory System, Nervous System, Respiratory System and so on. This abstract level of thinking is called System Thinking. Main ideas of System Thinking is taken from Control System Theory. Peter M. Senge, author of 'The Fifth Discipline', try to explain difficulties in learning this new language of System Thinking and same applies to Control System also.
 
Please read the following pages from Peter M. Senge's The Fifth Discipline Book:

Similarly Classical Control System Theory consists of various new ideas and tools. These tools helps to view the world in new light - in abstract s-domain. So to be familiar with the control systems ideas and tools please go through the lectures by Brian Douglas. These are very interesting lectures on Classical Control Systems and what I like about these lectures are he makes you understand various terms of control theory with various examples and beautiful diagrams.

    				Reduce inbox clutter:
    				
    					
    						Redirect student emails to Piazza
    						Replace your class distribution list
    						Use private posts to communicate with other instructors
    					
    				
    				Set the tone for the class:
    				
    					
    						Post announcements the first week of class
    						Endorse and encourage student responses
    						Encourage collaborative editing
    						Go for visual posts
    					
    				
    				Keep the class on track:
    				
    					
    						Manage your class folders
    						Link to other questions
    						Mark questions duplicate
    						Edit or delete anything
    					
    				
    			
    			
    				
    					« prev
    					next »
    				
    				
    					
	    					When students email instructors with individual questions, your teaching staff may find itself answering the same questions over and over. When a question is posted on Piazza, it only needs to be answered once.

							When students post on Piazza, everyone benefits. Students like knowing that others have the same question, and when it's answered on Piazza, it's answered for everybody. 

							Ask students to post their questions to Piazza instead of emailing you directly. Some instructors choose to respond to emailed questions by redirecting the students to Piazza. Others like to copy questions from emails or office hours and post them directly on the site so the answer can benefit the entire class (and save you some time!).
						
						
	    					Piazza makes it easy to post announcements to the entire class anytime. By posting announcements on Piazza, you can see any responses to the announcement all in one place rather than letting them fill your inbox.

							To post an announcement, click ""+ New Post"" and select the ""Note"" tab, which lets you create a post that does not require a response. To make the announcement to the entire class immediately, regardless of their email settings, just check the box labeled ""Send immediately to the entire class."" All members of the class will receive an email notification of the post right away. It's a great way to get important information out fast. 

							
						
						
	    					Piazza's private posts make it easy to keep all instructor dialogue in one place. When creating a new post, check the box labeled ""Make this a private question."" When an instructor adds a private post, only other class instructors can view it. Look for the blue ""Private"" label in the question feed on the left. 

							Students can also create private posts. When a student creates one, only that student and the class's instructors can view the post. Student-created private posts are useful for asking questions when the student is unsure whether the material may be shared with the entire class. If the post contains information that the entire class would benefit from, an instructor can always make the private post public using the menu that appears left of the question's title in the question feed. 

							
						
						
	    					As soon as you've enrolled your class, let students know you're active on Piazza by adding a couple announcements.

							The first few posts are a great opportunity to share basic information about the class, like when office hours are and how you can be contacted. Many instructors also like to lay out the ground rules for posting questions and answers on Piazza. 

							Add a new post by clicking ""+ New Post"" at the top of your screen and filling in the details. Select the ""Note"" tab if you're posting an announcement and don't require a response.

							
						
						
	    					Click ""Good Question"" or ""Good Answer"" to encourage students to ask questions and respond to classmates' questions.

	    					
						
						
	    					Piazza questions and answers are like Wikipedia: anyone can contribute to them. Collaboratively edited questions and answers are far easier to read and comprehend than a long thread of comments.

							The answer to each question is divided into a students' answer (for all students to edit) and an instructors' answer (for all instructors to edit). When you read a good students' answer, click ""Good Answer!"" to endorse it—this helps encourage students to answer others' questions. Plus, when students see the checkmark over the students' answer icon in the question feed, they know that that endorsed students' answer is just as good as any instructors' answer.  

							Another good way to encourage students to edit the students' answer is to refine what other students have written. Anyone can view the contributions individuals made to the response by using the Question History slider that appears above the question after several edits.

							
						
						
	    					We know from experience that visual posts can communicate concepts very effectively. Embed images, attach files, and format math and code to make posts clean and easily understandable.

	    					Easily include blocks of pre-formatted code by selecting the pre button in the question editor, and include inline code snippets by selecting the tt button for teletype text. For mathematical equations, click the Fx icon to access a LaTeX editor.

							See our formatting page for more details on how to format your posts.

							
						
						
	    					Folders make it easy to filter questions by a particular assignment or topic. Classes start out and stay more organized when instructors create folders for a class before it starts.
							Specify your class's folders in your manage class page. Click the ""Manage Class"" link at the top of your screen.

							
						
						
	    					Create a hyperlink to another post by typing the ""@"" symbol followed by that post's number (e.g. @102). Find a post's number by looking in the URL, or by hovering over the arrow to the left of the question's title in the question feed. 

							
						
						
	    					If you notice that a question has been asked before, mark it as a duplicate question to avoid confusion. Select the ""Mark as Duplicate"" option in the duplicate question's more menu and follow the directions. To limit the number of duplicate questions that arise, as soon as there is a significant number of posts in your class, we'll do our part to keep things organized by requiring students to search existing posts before adding their own.

	    					
						
						
	    					As an instructor, you have full editing capabilities over all class content. You can also delete posts via the more menu or question feed drop down menu. Students do not have the ability to delete posts.

        Post a Welcome Note!
        
          In your first post on Piazza, welcome your students to their new class:
          
            Students,

Welcome to Piazza! We'll be conducting all class-related discussion here this term. The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand a concept—you can even do so anonymously.

",11/7/16,
iv7owc53ovx6c7,Week 11/6 - 11/12,      Welcome to Piazza!,"Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:1.  Ask questions!The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).2.  Edit questions and answers wiki-style.Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors).3.  Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.4.  Go anonymous.Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.5.  Tag your posts.It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.6.  Format code and equations.Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.7.  View and download class details and resources.Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com. We love feedback!",11/7/16,
