Kindly communicate when you will ship/submit the robotic kit via email at helpdesk@e-yantra.org mentioning the Team ID, Theme and Date by which the team will return/submit the kit.

Kindly note the following instructions for the finals of Harvester Bot:
 
1. Formula as mentioned in the Rule-book will remain same.
2. Direction of attaching the Fruits will begin from the Trees side facing e-Yantra in clockwise fashion as already mentioned in the rulebook.
3. In the finals teams will be getting Trees of 4.25 inches of diameter due to unavailability of the 4 inch ones. Teams are advised to make slight changes regarding the same. Moreover the practice arena for the same will open a day before the competition hence teams can also calibrate here at IIT Bombay.

          While we were giving a final run to our bot for the bonus task, we had very less time remaining. So after shooting the video of the bonus task, when we merged the introductory video with the bonus task video, then don't know why after merging, our final video got trimmed by 7 seconds and the merged video was reduced to exactly 4 minutes, and in hurry we din't notice this mistake,  though this problem din't occur while merging the original video configuration with introductory video. Even there may have been any mistake by us while merging the videos which led the blunder.
 
           Thus due to this we missed to show the stopping of bot on shed and blinking the LED in order at shed. Long after we uploaded the bonus video configuration we noticed our blunder. So its a big request to team e-Yantra if we could get any help or would permit us to submit the bonus configuration video again.

Planter Bot Theme,
 
It’s time for the task 4 of the eYRC 2017.
 
Task 4 will be launched today midnight. The details regarding time for submitting task/ deadlines/ bonus tasks will appear on portal once the task is launched.
 
IMP: Before downloading Task 4 read the instructions on the portal carefully and then download.
 
On the basis of progress videos we saw, we suggest the Planter Bot teams to follow below guidelines, apart from which you will receive in task.
       Lighting conditions: We would advise you to shoot the video in a bright environment. You may use electric light, etc. to improve visibility in video. Please follow @1587 to get an idea of the lighting conditions at finals.       RGB LED: Planter Bot has to blink RGB LEDs from time to time as required in the tasks. Please place your LED on the bot such that blinking of RGB LED is easily visible in the video.
 
At this point in time, we would advise you to optimize your code/algo as much as possible in order to get better results in the task. However, if not necessary then try to restrain from implementing new concepts/techniques which may consume your time as it will require debugging.
 
We hope all the teams to give the best performance.
 
All The Best!!!",2/22/18,"planter_bot,Planter_Bot"

The PZ-4 in the plantation image is small and hence is posing a little problem with overlay images with landscape orientation. Since the aspect ratio of some of the images is large, we are not able to downsize them without losing the visibility and we are having to compromise by skewing the aspect ratio to provide proper visibility.
It would be really helpful if you could give us an insight of how could this problem be solved.
I am also attaching an image of my understanding of PZ-4, it may be possible that i am mistaken.

We are getting problem with left wheel of Firebird V robot.
1)During forward motion it goes straight upto certain distance after that it tends to move towards right.
2)During backward motion instead of coming back it turns left,keeping left wheel stationary.
3)During left turn its left wheel remains stationary,only right wheel is rotating.

jd535xxfwbn4en,Week 1/28 - 2/3,      Similarity of arena to the one given right now,"Respected Sir/Ma'am
Quoting Questions @1443 and @1140 , 
On my last question, Avijit sir answered 

We have provided an arena design. Features like line thickness, types of terrain, cell size etc will remain same in the arena. 
 
Based on the physical orientation of the camera, the line thickness visible to the robot will vary. Students are free to position the PiCam on the Planter Bot according to their own design choice. 
 
Based on the positioning of the PiCam, things like trigonometric calculations etc will also change.

We would be really grateful if you could tell us if the arena in the finals would be same as the one we have right now?
 
Also, it would be a really great help if you could please tell that do the different terrains really mean anything in context of arena, like is the order pre-determined and we can hardcode optimised algorithms to traverse that particular terrain, or the names given to the terrain just imply real life implementations and the robot has to traverse arena normally with the normal algorithm it is using to traversing the rest of the arena.

jcme41rhm0pgc,Week 1/14 - 1/20,      Position Encoder not working,"We tried to test the Position Encoder . So we copied the code given in the Experiments folder and pasted in new project (made in atmel studio 7 with device atmega2560) and build it. We burned the Hex file generated  but we were not getting the desired result. 
We have checked the code and cross checked the configuration with Data sheet of Atmega2560 and concluded that code is correct.  
After checking code, we burned the same code but reduced wheel velocity very much and tested the voltage of the output data via multimeter of the encoder. Our expectations was the voltage should go above 3.3V(for logical high) and below it( for logical low) as wheel rotates but we found that :
Output voltage remain between 1.08V to 1.02V . Sometimes it remains 1.08V and and sometimes it changes to 1.02V.
After this test we concluded that although code is correct but encoder is never going from high to low ( falling edge) that's why external interrupt is not getting enabled and that's why we are not getting desired result.
The last thing we did to test is that we burned the Hex file provided with the position code given in Experiments folder. When we burned the Hex file the first time bot did the same we were expecting. We don't know how it did because we were burning the hex code (generated via atmel studio 7) of the same code but we were not getting the result. To cross check it we again burnt the same hex file present in the experiments folder with the code. This time bot did not worked correctly.  We don't know why it happened as we have burnt the code successfully and correctly.
End conclusion:
1)By Hex code generated: 
    Encodersare always giving logical low . So, External interrupt is  not getting enabled. Thus unable to get  desired result.
2) Already given Hex code :
     At first it worked well but when we re-burnt the same hex file it didn't worked .
Please look into this issue. And tell us whether our end conclusion is correct or not. If it is correct then tell us a solution to rectify the issue !

We are making our program follow a modular approach with separate modules for each routine to keep the source file clean and simple.
Now, we do not know the format in which E-Yantra would expect the task from us. So, is it okay to continue with a modular approach or should we define separate functions in a single source file.
 
Thank You,
