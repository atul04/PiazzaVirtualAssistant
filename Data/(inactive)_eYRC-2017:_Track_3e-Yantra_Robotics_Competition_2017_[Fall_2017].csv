Dear Participants,
 
The competition closes on 26th February, 11:59 PM.
 
Hence, teams who had downloaded their Original configuration well before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM can still submit their task before the competition closes with penalty as per the policy on portal.
 
Teams who downloaded the configuration just before 24th Feb, 11:59 PM have only 48 hours to submit their task. No submission for Original configuration or for Code submission will be considered (even via an email) after 26th February, 11:59 PM.
 
Hence, we request teams to kindly pace up their work and avoid last moment rush.
 
Teams should submit their Original task with Code well before the deadline, maybe by 9 or 10 PM tomorrow. Many teams try to submit their task at the last moment due to which the server gets loaded and then they aren't able to submit their task on time. So, please avoid such situations for your benefit.
 
 
You can download the Bonus configuration even with penalty or zero score on Original configuration till 26th Feb, midnight.

 

But, the last date to submit the video for Bonus task is 26th Feb, midnight. Though there is no penalty for Code and Bonus video submission, the submission won't be considered after 26th Feb midnight.
 
 
Thank you.

 
All the best !!

jdycofvi7hk5dm,Pinned,      Before Task 4 Release,"Dear Participants,
Here are a couple of guidelines before Task 4 release.

1)  As informed earlier, Task 4 - Original Configuration will be available for download from Midnight, 22nd February, 2018 to Midnight 24th February, 2018. Once you download the Original Configuration, a countdown timer of 48 hours will start. You will have 48 hours from time of first download to submit your solution for this Original Configuration without any penalty. 

2) Code Submission -  Code submission instructions will be given with Original Configuration download. You need to clean up your working code according to the ""Coding Standard"" given on portal. Code submission final deadline is Midnight, 26th February.

3) Bonus Configuration - Bonus Configuration will be available for download to teams who have submitted the video demonstration (even with penalty) for the Original Configuration. Bonus Configuration will be evaluated ONLY if you have a working solution for the Original Configuration. 

You can submit the Bonus Configuration till Midnight, February 26th, 2018 when the competition closes. No extensions will be allowed.


4) Midnight, February 26th, 2018 is the hard deadline for the competition. Original, Bonus, and Code should be submitted before that. 

5) Be careful of when you download the Original Configuration since it will dictate how much time you get for bonus configuration. 

For example, if you download the Original on 23rd Feb at 6:00PM, you will get till 25th Feb, 6:00PM to submit without penalty. If you submit at 5:00 PM, you will get till 26th 11:59PM to submit Bonus and Code.

However, if you download the original on 24th Feb, at 11:00PM and submit it on 26th Feb 10:30 - 11:00 PM, you will get hardly enough time to shoot and submit the Bonus. 

So plan accordingly. Don't download too late, or too early.

6) In the original configuration, the starting position and orientation of robots will be given along with position and colour of plants. You are allowed to initialise the starting position of robots in the code, but are not allowed to hardcode the position of plants in the code. Your robot algorithm should be dynamic enough that regardless of the starting position of robot, the run should work perfectly.

7) Don't forget the Plant colour indications using RGB led!! Before a robot fertilizes / weeds a Plant, it should indicate the color of the Plant by glowing the corresponding color on the RGB Led.

8) Make sure the lighting conditions you shoot the video are uniform. They will make a lot of difference in colour sensing.

Best of Luck !!!!

jdcviyjx1gd5x,Pinned,      Color Sensor Interfacing,"Since a lot of students are having problem with color sensor interfacing with Spark V, here's some more help.
 
As mentioned earlier you have to configure Timer Input Capture Mode to capture the pulses from the colour sensor.
 
Below given is a small snippet of code which will help you. But don't copy paste it blindly, understand what it does. 
 
volatile unsigned long int pulse = 0;   // <---- volatile is important !!!
unsigned long int red;       // variable to store the red pulse count
unsigned long int blue;      // variable to store the blue pulse count
unsigned long int green;     // variable to store the green pulse count

void color_sensor_pin_config(void)
{
	DDRD  =      ;            //set PD6 as input for color sensor output
	PORTD =      ;            //Enable internal pull-up for PORTD 6 pin
	DDRC =       ;            //Initialise pins connected to S0, S1, S2, S3 as output
        PORTC =      ;            // Set pins as LOW initialially
}

void color_sensor_pin_interrupt_init(void) //Interrupt 0 enable
{
	cli();               //Clears the global interrupt
	TIMSK= TIMSK | 0x20; // Enable input capture pin of timer 1 for color sensor
	sei();               // Enables the global interrupt
}

ISR(TIMER1_CAPT_vect)
{
	pulse++; //increment on receiving pulse from the color sensor
}

void timer1_init2(void)
{
	TCNT1H = 0x00;
	TCNT1L = 0x00;
	OCR1AH = 0x00;
	OCR1AL = 0x00;
	OCR1BH = 0x00;
	OCR1BL = 0x00;
	TCCR1A = 0x00;
	TCCR1B = 0x01; //at clock frequency
	TIMSK = 0x20;
}
Complete the above code and try to capture pulses from the color sensor and display it on the LCD or XCTU console. After it works, implement the logic for color detection.
 
A word of caution - 
1) Timer 1 is being used by both color sensor and motor. Both have different initialisations. Before you the function to sense color, you must called the timer1_init2 function. After sensing is complete, reinitialise the timer 1 as per required for motor control and disable input capture mode.

jda5ffocx59qs,Pinned,      Servo Interfacing HACK,"Hey Guys, 
Here is another tutorial for servo interfacing. Since a lot of students are facing trouble initilalizing the 8 bit timers for servo, here is a nifty hack you can use. Though i must warn you, its a hack so it may do the job for you but it's still important to learn how to initialize timers and stuff.
 
So before we start, we need to learn how the PWM signal generated for servos works.
So you must be knowing the normal PWM mode for controlling speed of motors.

Here the Duty Cycle is the most important component. The Amount of power delivered to the motor(hence speed of the motor) depends on the duty cycle.
In case of servo motor, it is different.

For servo motors, the length of the T_on pulse determines the angle of the servo. The T_off pulse usually has an almost constant length (varying between 10-20 ms).
For example if you give a T_on pulse of 1ms, the servo will rotate to 0 degree.
                     if you give a T_on pulse of 2ms, the servo will rotate to 180 degree.
 
So to get any angle between (0-180) degrees, you need to map the values to pulse length between 1 - 2 ms.
 
So now we get how the servo PWM works, we can write a code to generate a signal
 
void servo1_pin_config (void)
{
	DDRD  =                    //making PORTD 7 pin output      <------- Fill this out yourself!!
	PORTD =                    //setting PORTD 7 pin to logic 0 <------ Fill this out yourself !!
}

void servo1(int delaytime)
{
	for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++)
	{
		PORTD =                 // Make PD7 High
		delay_us(delaytime);    // T_on duration
		PORTD =                 // Make PD7 Low
		delay_ms(20);           // T_off duration
	}
}

 
A word of caution before you use this
1) T_on pulse for servo angles 0-180 varies from servo to servo. You need to calibrate it specifically for the servo you are using.
2) While the for loop is running, your robot will not be able to do anything else. It does not run the servo parallely with the microcontroller like the timer initialisation does.
3) This is not advisable for actuating the servos in robotic arms which carry load. The reason being that while the for loop is running, the servo is actuated to the specific angle. But once the loop is completed the servo becomes free. Which means it will not be able to hold that position if an external force or torque is applied on it. So it will be not able to hold a load.

jd9v1olxn8j2zy,Pinned,      XBee Interfacing,"Since it has been evident that many students are having problems with XBee interfacing, there's some more information about this.
XBee acts as a wireless UART link between two microcontrollers or a microcontroller and a PC. As I told a lot of people during the review sessions, the first step is to configure the XBees properly.
 
Follow the XBee Configuration tutorial to configure the XBees properly. Ideally, you would want to configure the XBees to 9600 bps. You can choose other baud rates as well, its your own discretion.
 
Next you will need to read more about Serial Communication. Read in detail from Spark V Software Manual and try to understand the function of all Registers.
 
Below given is a small snippet of code which will help you. But don't copy paste it blindly, understand what it does. 
 
volatile char data;       //   <--------------   Volatile is very important!!!
#define TE  (1<<5)

void uart_init()          // Don't forget to call this function!!
{
	UCSRB = 0x00;                     //disable while setting baud rate
        UCSRA = 0x00;
	UCSRC = 0x86;
	UBRRL = 0x2F;         // Set according to baud rate!!
	UBRRH = 0x00;         
	UCSRB = 0x98;			  //enabling receiver and transmit
}

void uart_tx(char data)
{
	while(!(UCSRA & TE));			//waiting to transmit
	UDR = data;
}

ISR(USART_RXC_vect) 
{ 
   data = UDR;
}
Go through the code and try to transmit and receive data from your XCTU console to robot.

jc0dp1e0iqs8q,Pinned,      Hints and Tips for Interfacing Hardware (with Spark V and Firebird V),"Dear Participants,
The following are some hints and tips for interfacing hardware with the robots.
 
Color Sensor
For interfacing color sensor with spark V you will need to access additional GPIO (To connect S0, S1, S2 and S3). You can remove the LCD from the Spark V robot and use the pins for interfacing the color sensor.Read about Timer Input Capture Mode in Atmega 16 to interface color sensor with Atmega 16Use the same color paper for covering the Plants as the sample provided to you. Many teams in Task 2 have used other shades of color paper which will be a pain for thresholding.Test your color sensor for different distance ranges and apply thresholding accordingly. The pulse count varies drastically aas the distance changes.
Sharp Sensor
For interfacing the sharp sensor with Spark V, use the slot provided for ultrasonic sensors on the Spark V. Read the Spark V hardware manual details.You need to enable the ultrasonic sensor slot by changing the jumper first before interfacing.
XBee
Instructions to configure XBee in AT Mode have been given in the Hardware Testing Folder.For the Zigbee firmware we are using (802.15.4) , there are only two modes for Zigbee Configuration (Coordinator /End Point). Configuring all XBees in network as End Point will work fine for communication. It is not necessary that one of them needs to be configured as Coordinator.You can use any other Zigbee firmware or mode as well if you want.Go through the Experiments folder at http://elsi.e-yantra.org/resources to study the Zigbee example codeXBee acts a wireless UART link once properly configured so read in detail about UART communicationThe Firebird has 4 UART ports out of which XBee is connected on UART0 portSpark V has only one UART port. So XBee and USB are multiplexed out of the same port. You need to switch the USB-Xbee jumper to switch between modes.
Servo
You need to study about timers and PWM to find out how to interface servos.There is a slot already provided for Servo connection on Spark V. Read the manuals and datasheet to know the timers it is connected to and how to configure the timerFor the Spark V, it is recommended you only drive micro servo using the robot since the Standard servo draws a lot of current which cannot be supplied by the Spark V battery.
White Line Following
Apply proper thresholding for each of the white line sensor.You can adjust the intensity of red led using the potentiometer provided.
 
Will add more to this section as I think of them.

If you are facing trouble uploading code to Firebird/Spark V using AVR bootloader, you could try using the STK Programmer to burn the bootloader to your robot.
 
Download the following files and extract to your desktop 
AVRDUDE_SparkV.zip
AVRDUDE_ATMEGA2560.zip
 
Now connect the STK with robot and switch it on.
 
After opening command prompt go to the AVR folder extracted on desktop.
cd Desktop/AVRDUDE_SparkV

After going to AVR folder path write below command
stkrun bootloader.a90

then Final path will be like,
C:\Users\eyantra\Desktop\AVRDUDE_SparkV>stkrun bootloader.a90

Now the boot loader has been burned in your robot, to burn hex file you can use AVR Bootloader.
OR
By using STK you can burn the hex file into the robot,  just you have to replace bootloader.a90 file with your hex file.
 
If you still have any confusion then read the STK manual.

3. ReachDestinationAvoidingNode(2,'A',2,'C')
 
So you can place only one obstacle at a time in the sequential manner 
1. put obstacle on (6,D) while its going to (5,D)
2. put obstacle on (2,D) while its going to (2,F)
3. put obstacle on (2,C) while its going to (2,A)

I would like to take a moment to thank all the Instructors / Classmates for helping throughout the competition. It was our first time in Engineering Environment where we actually implemented what we had studied in academics which would have eventually rott if we weren't given this opportunity. We understood the actual importance of memory management , power management and the needful optimisation to over come them. Our Problem solving skills improved highly in this competition .. We came up with things which We never imagined we ever could. Although we weren't able to complete the task 4 due to our own mistakes , it was a great experience overall.

Dear sir,
White line sensors of one of the spark V provided is not working properly. Whenever we try to adjust the potentiometer connected to white line sensors it gives values as follows:-
 
When all IR lights are adjusted to the maximum brightness, the side sensor values range from 0-(~169) while the middle ranges  0-(~155) (ideally the values range from  0-255).On setting the IR sensors to minimum brightness all of them give a range of 0-(~9). (ideally, it ranges from 0- ~180) 
 
The picture attached has the two bots configured for maximum IR lights brightness. One of the bots(left) shows correct value while the right bot has damaged white line sensors.
 
REQUEST 1:
 
Our college has a few fine working spark v bots with them, however, the white line sensors are not the same as on the bots sent us by eyantra. They have sensors resembling IR proximity sensors.
We would like to request you for permission to use the college provided spark V.

Also, what should be the optimization settings in Atmel Studio? (-O0 or -O1?). We have clean built the solution, F_CPU is verified and tried everything. Please suggest what to do. Is there something else that we are missing? We are currently uploading code using the bootloader.

But the ""Hardware Testing"" folder for our theme does not contain any instructions for it. Note that we have acknowledged the receiving of the kit before the deadline for the task.
 
Another thing is that they called a ""team member"" and not the ""team leader"" even when the profile of team leader is complete and the phone number given is working. This caused confusion at the time of call since these details are supposed to be filled by the team leader.

P.S : I have made the header files properly, with source and .h and everything that there is to made them also went through the ""Creating header files"" section in the description pdf of task1B.",12/4/17,feederweeder

Is is necessary to keep tack of previous obstacles on track while the bot is making its way to the destination 
 
 
The last obstacle is on 2D ... 
 
Bot is on 2F and wants to reach 2A with obstacle on 2C
 
So we have 2 obstacles ( 3 infact - the first one on 6D)  or just one on 2C ( means we have to remove obstacle after bot reaches its destination) ?

I've uploaded the FB5_USB_GUI.hex code into the bot and the lCD displays this text ""FB5 GUI MODE NEX ROBOTICS IND"". And according to the instructions the GUI should show the com port at which the bot is assigned to, but it doesn't show any com port connected. The problem i guess may be the baud rate written in the code for serial communication, which may not be matching to the one initialized in the GUI. Maybe i'm wrong, I'm just speculating. Kindly provide guidance.

          In your first post on Piazza, welcome your students to their new class:
          
            Students,

Welcome to Piazza! We'll be conducting all class-related discussion here this term. The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand a concept—you can even do so anonymously.

	    					When students email instructors with individual questions, your teaching staff may find itself answering the same questions over and over. When a question is posted on Piazza, it only needs to be answered once.

							When students post on Piazza, everyone benefits. Students like knowing that others have the same question, and when it's answered on Piazza, it's answered for everybody. 

							Ask students to post their questions to Piazza instead of emailing you directly. Some instructors choose to respond to emailed questions by redirecting the students to Piazza. Others like to copy questions from emails or office hours and post them directly on the site so the answer can benefit the entire class (and save you some time!).
						
						
	    					Piazza makes it easy to post announcements to the entire class anytime. By posting announcements on Piazza, you can see any responses to the announcement all in one place rather than letting them fill your inbox.

							To post an announcement, click ""+ New Post"" and select the ""Note"" tab, which lets you create a post that does not require a response. To make the announcement to the entire class immediately, regardless of their email settings, just check the box labeled ""Send immediately to the entire class."" All members of the class will receive an email notification of the post right away. It's a great way to get important information out fast. 

							
						
						
	    					Piazza's private posts make it easy to keep all instructor dialogue in one place. When creating a new post, check the box labeled ""Make this a private question."" When an instructor adds a private post, only other class instructors can view it. Look for the blue ""Private"" label in the question feed on the left. 

							Students can also create private posts. When a student creates one, only that student and the class's instructors can view the post. Student-created private posts are useful for asking questions when the student is unsure whether the material may be shared with the entire class. If the post contains information that the entire class would benefit from, an instructor can always make the private post public using the menu that appears left of the question's title in the question feed. 

							
						
						
	    					As soon as you've enrolled your class, let students know you're active on Piazza by adding a couple announcements.

							The first few posts are a great opportunity to share basic information about the class, like when office hours are and how you can be contacted. Many instructors also like to lay out the ground rules for posting questions and answers on Piazza. 

							Add a new post by clicking ""+ New Post"" at the top of your screen and filling in the details. Select the ""Note"" tab if you're posting an announcement and don't require a response.

							
						
						
	    					Click ""Good Question"" or ""Good Answer"" to encourage students to ask questions and respond to classmates' questions.

	    					
						
						
	    					Piazza questions and answers are like Wikipedia: anyone can contribute to them. Collaboratively edited questions and answers are far easier to read and comprehend than a long thread of comments.

							The answer to each question is divided into a students' answer (for all students to edit) and an instructors' answer (for all instructors to edit). When you read a good students' answer, click ""Good Answer!"" to endorse it—this helps encourage students to answer others' questions. Plus, when students see the checkmark over the students' answer icon in the question feed, they know that that endorsed students' answer is just as good as any instructors' answer.  

							Another good way to encourage students to edit the students' answer is to refine what other students have written. Anyone can view the contributions individuals made to the response by using the Question History slider that appears above the question after several edits.

							
						
						
	    					We know from experience that visual posts can communicate concepts very effectively. Embed images, attach files, and format math and code to make posts clean and easily understandable.

	    					Easily include blocks of pre-formatted code by selecting the pre button in the question editor, and include inline code snippets by selecting the tt button for teletype text. For mathematical equations, click the Fx icon to access a LaTeX editor.

							See our formatting page for more details on how to format your posts.

							
						
						
	    					Folders make it easy to filter questions by a particular assignment or topic. Classes start out and stay more organized when instructors create folders for a class before it starts.
							Specify your class's folders in your manage class page. Click the ""Manage Class"" link at the top of your screen.

							
						
						
	    					Create a hyperlink to another post by typing the ""@"" symbol followed by that post's number (e.g. @102). Find a post's number by looking in the URL, or by hovering over the arrow to the left of the question's title in the question feed. 

							
						
						
	    					If you notice that a question has been asked before, mark it as a duplicate question to avoid confusion. Select the ""Mark as Duplicate"" option in the duplicate question's more menu and follow the directions. To limit the number of duplicate questions that arise, as soon as there is a significant number of posts in your class, we'll do our part to keep things organized by requiring students to search existing posts before adding their own.

	    					
						
						
	    					As an instructor, you have full editing capabilities over all class content. You can also delete posts via the more menu or question feed drop down menu. Students do not have the ability to delete posts.

Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above. Go anonymous.Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously. Tag your posts.It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag.
