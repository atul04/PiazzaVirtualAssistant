j0ledv3pkdy7c,Pinned,        Navigate_A_Terrain ,"Dear Finalists,
There is a minor change in the Scoring Criteria for the finals.
Below given formula will be used for scoring during the finals.
 
Total Score = (720-T) + CIC*70 + CAC*70 + CP*50 - RP*70 - P*30 + OB

The scaling factors for CIC (Correct Identification of Checkpoints) and CAC(Correct Acknowledgement of Checkpoints) have been increased from 50 to 70.
Good Luck for the finals !

j0jtq0n51d23kk,Pinned,        Navigate_A_Terrain ,"Dear Finalists,
For Navigate a Terrain,
1) You are allowed to use your own laptops to run your code (to process the MAP image) during the finals. Laptops will be taken from you before the final arena configuration is revealed and no changes in the code after that.
2) Before taking the laptops from teams, we will copy the MAP image in the location specified by the team on the laptop. The map image will be named ""MAP.jpg"".
3) Please ensure there is sufficient charge in your laptop. The same thing holds for Rover and Base Station batteries/power banks. Please ensure there are fully charged before the run.

Dear Finalists,
 
Here are few suggestions which you can choose to follow for your theme:

Teams may have to use re-position/restart in case your bot goes haywire, so your code should be ready to handle re-position/restart. Study about the rules regarding these carefully.

Always have the battery sufficiently charged for the final demonstration, or keep extra battery if you have. Remember e-Yantra won't provide you another battery.
Each team will be provided with a laptop to run the code for the practice session. Laptops will have both linux and windows installed. You may have to install your respective libraries to run your code.One practice arena is provided amongst 5 teams. We are opening up practice room early for LM and expect teams to understand importance of time and help each other. Your focus should be to calibrate your code for given light condition.We will provide you objects and obstacle blocks, however you can carry few on your own in case you need it.

iztott27y0y5fb,Pinned,        Model_a_Terrain,"We are receiving many queries on Piazza and Helpdesk regarding the problem you are facing to interface Color Sensor and GY-87.
 
Using INT2 interrupt for Color sensor, you have to desolder the MAX 202 connections.
If you are not getting that then there is an alternative way.
 
Use pinchange interrupt.
Connect OUT pin of color sensor to pin 44 (PJ3) on expansion slot.
 
Code using pin change interrupt for color sensor is : Color_Sensor.cpp
 
All the best!

Being a part of eyantra was a wonderful experience . We are first year students , thus were quite nervous in the beginning of the competition but just after task - 1 we realised that it was so well organised that a person having patience can perform his/her best .
I personally liked the idea of providing study material regarding each and every task . This was the best part of eyantra as it brings every participant at equal stage. I really liked this competition and hope that next time will make it to IIT Bombay .
Being new to micro controller and its interfacing with blender we faced many challenges , in fact this was the most difficult part for us. We request the eyantra team to provide a detailed tutorial on xbee communication with blender so that we can use this concept to link blender with any other micro controller , this could also help us in building interesting and useful projects.

j099ixi7fy54u,Week 3/12 - 3/18,        CCFinals," Dear Finalists,
 
Here are few suggestions which you can choose to follow for your theme:


If you are not using perspective transformation then it will be difficult for you to calibrate your robot based upon the arena we will provide to you practice session.

Teams may have to use re-position/restart in case your bot goes haywire, so your code should be ready to handle re-position/restart. Study about the rules regarding these carefully.

Teams are not required to display numbers on LCD, just display on the python console.

Always have the battery sufficiently charged for the final demonstration, or keep extra battery if you have. Remember e-Yantra won't provide you another battery.

Team can use the algorithm described here (click here) for full-proof number detection. 
Each team will be provided with a laptop to run the code for the practice session. Laptops will have both linux and windows installed. You may have to install your respective libraries to run your code.

Comments section in our result states that Laser pointer is not focused correctly on the arena.We increased the area of focus for our laser so that image processing can be done well,otherwise it wouldn't have been possible to detect it.Please tell me if any marks have been deducted for this reason.If it is,that doesn't seem fair.

Here are the specifications

Please know that the dimensions of base-station and rover is fixed. Some of you have made the base station taller than the specified height.This is subject to disqualification.Map has  black markers(checkpoints) to specify the position of checkpoints on the arena.RGB led on the Rover and Base Station should be lit(refer rule-book).Passing an array/list from laptop to the Base station for spotter to move, should be think properly. How to correlate the movement of servos according to the processed MAP?There is a difference in theoretical and practical implementation.Please find that is it practically possible to achieve 0-180 degree in a servo?Ready made gripper is not allowed (already specified in rule book).Don't just do stuff, know why and how are you doing it. Learn the technology behind how things work. For example, what is WIFI  (you can google it to find the answer, or if you have doubt post on piazza), similarly what is DC and servo motor.How node_MCU can be utilized efficiently?Do not assume things, If you have doubt, ask about it on Piazza. We will try to resolve it to best possible extent.Follow coding standards. You will be asked to submit your code for final implementation.Some teams have copied texts from rule-book and Task descriptions, we know about it and for now we have let it go by deducting some marks in Task-4. Please do not fool around, we have enough experience and expertise to find such things. We have disqualified 2 such teams in Stage-1 for copying code and we can do so, if required in Stage-2.

On evaluation of Task-4 submitted by teams, we found some common mistakes/misconception with teams. Below are some tips, we consider can help you. Note that these are generic, we are not directed to on any single teams. 
 
 
For a colour-marker in door area, there can be multiple matching objects in working area but only one object need to deposited in door area. Other Object(s) will act as an Obstacle.( with reference to Q7 of Task-4)Some teams have not followed the arena configuration for Task-4. For video submission (Task-5) ensure that arena is setup as per given configuration. For wrong arena setup, score will be evaluated to zero.Ready made gripper is not allowed (already specified in rule book)Some teams are using 3-servo motors for pick-placer mechanism. Think whether it is required. Some suggested mechanism can be done with just two. For example gripping part can be done with one. More servos means more power consumption. Think about you mechanism. Note: This is just a suggestion and not mandate, do whatever is good and possible for you.Don't just do stuff, know why and how are you doing it. Learn the technology behind how things work. For example, what is Xbee and Zigbee (you can google it to find the answer, or if you have doubt post on piazza), similarly what is DC and servo motor, difference between sharp sensors and proximity sensors, how these works. Some of you have mentioned using robot body (green color and circular shape) for position and orientation detection. It is difficult because color on robot surface is not uniform. We are not discouraging you to do this, but make sure you try it immediately and improvise on idea if required. We suggest that for robot position and orientation detection, you can make use of Sharp and/or proximity sensors already present on the robot as well the overhead camera. This would help you get a more accurate estimate and this in turn would ensure you run into fewer problems due to incorrect detection.Do not assume things, If you have doubt, ask about it on Piazza. We will try to resolve it to best possible extent.Follow coding standards. You will be asked to submit your code for final implementation.Some teams have copied texts from rulebook and Task descriptions, we know about it and for now we have let it go by deducting some marks in Task-4. Please do not fool around, we have enough experience and expertise to find such things. We have disqualified 2 such teams in Stage-1 for copying code and we can do so, if required in Stage-2.

3.The fig3 shows that the boulder completely fits into the cavity and the sunboard ensures the smooth travelling of firebird.

Task 4 results have been released, please check the same on the portal. Pay attention to the comments and feedback provided.
 
A few general instructions for theme implementation:
 

1. In few image submissions we have found that the black rectangle of the Arena is not fully visible. In such case web-camera should be manually rotated to change from portrait to landscape mode.
 
2. You can use template matching/contour detection for determining Cavities and Obstacles in the arena.
 
3. Cavities should be circular.
 
4. Only one sharp sensor is allowed(provided in the kit). No other sensors apart from the one provided in the kit/Firebird V are allowed.
 
5. Usage of too many actuators simultaneously may lead to rapid current surge.
 
6. IR proximity sensor might not be suitable to detect Obstacles due to varying heights.
 
7. Use concepts of capturing Region of Interest and Perspective transformation to capture the region inside the black rectangle.
 
8. Check the resource on portal, Image Processing guide has been updated.
 

Be ready for Progress Video submissions, all the best!!

Initially  the WiFi adapter stopped blinking .So  we tested the WiFi adapter and also  tried re-writing the image on the SD card. But still, the WiFi adapter did not respond when connected to the Pi. We searched online regarding this problem . It seems to be a case of board failure. The capacitor and IC chip get heated just within a few seconds, on powering the Raspberry Pi with the power bank. How should we proceed next?

                     1.By using  AVR BOOTLOADER GUI 
                     2.By using NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2
** In first method you can program the bot by using only the USB cable, no other ISP programmer is needed and It is strongly recommended that you only use this Bootloader method for programming robot 
**But if you use ""NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2"" programmer with the robot then boot section code might get erased and robot will no longer support boot loading. If you again wish to program the bot using AVR BOOTLOADER GUI you can follow this steps to burn again the bootloader 
 
STEP 1-Download this bootloader file M256014_7456MHz._USBUART_2.a90. and save it on you desktop.
**Note:Following steps are the same procedure that you follow while you use ""NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2"" programmer to program the bot**
STEP 2-plug the NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2 to your PC and then connect it to your robot and switch it ON
**In step 3 im assuming that you have already installed the avrdude if not please install it and continue**
STEP 3-Open the cmd and type the following command without the mentioned single quotes and press enter:-
'avrdude -c stk500v2 -p m2560 -P NEX-USB-ISP -U flash:w:""C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\M2560-14_7456MHz. USB-UART 2.a90"":i'
----It will take 5-6 minutes for avrdude to write and verify the bootloader in the configurable boot memory section of the micro controller. After writing is finished you can remove the NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2 from your bot and switch off the bot 
----Now you can follow the same steps provided in the manual for programming the bot using the AVR BOOTLOADER GUI.
 
***FINAL NOTE- HAVE PROPER PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN BOOT LOADER OPERATING PRINCIPLE, PROGRAMMING USING NEX AVR USB ISP STK500V2. FOLLOW THIS STEPS WITH CAUTIONS***

We have been receiving queries regarding the use of external components like diodes, bjt and regulator. We have discussed this matter within e-Yantra. The outcome of the discussion are as follows:
 
1>you are now Allowed to use any discrete components like diodes,bjt,regulator etc. You just have to ask for the permission to use the component on piazza.
2>You are not allowed to use any sensor or external board to control or communicate.

Could you please elaborate the conditions of Correct Parking.
 
Is it necessary for the bot to be completely inside the parking area, or just step into it, because given the dimensions of the parking area the rover cannot be completely inside it in any possible orientation.
 
It can only be partially, so that it does not enter the base area or any other Parking Zone",1/31/17,navigate_a_terrain
iyl75yzrrq775f,Week 1/29 - 2/4,      Question on algorithm,"Do we also have to explain the working of the functions or just put them in the flow chart with their name enough to explain their working.
For Instance, see_checkpoint(img) sees if there exists a checkpoint in the image or not, so do we have to explain how it sees the checkpoints, or just what it does.
 
Thank You",1/31/17,navigate_a_terrain
iyl5bbibj4v28t,Week 1/29 - 2/4,      Algorithm Question in Task 4,"Sir, 
The algorithm we are supposed to write, will it be final or can it change afterwards if out encounters any error. Also, in how much detail are we supposed to write it.",1/31/17,navigate_a_terrain
iykedoo31tr1z9,Week 1/29 - 2/4,      Regarding use of servo(s),"1)Will there be any penalty for using extra actuators?
2)Though e-Yantra has provided flexibility to use extra servos(actuators), during final evaluation will teams who have picked a boulder in minimum number of servos have an edge over the other teams?",1/30/17,cross_a_crater
