Kindly return the robotic kits as already stated on the previous post and communicated via email (check your e-Yantra portal for more details).
We understand that many teams are going through their exams, but sending/submitting kits will not take much of your time. Moreover, note that certificates will be withheld until we receive the kits.
 
We advise all the teams who have not yet returned the kit to us or submitted the kits to their college (whichever option is mentioned on the portal).
Kindly communicate when you will ship/submit the robotic kit via email at helpdesk@e-yantra.org mentioning the Team ID, Theme and Date by which the team will return/submit the kit.
 
PS: Kits include everything that you have been provided for the theme.

Kindly note the following instructions for the finals of Harvester Bot:
 
1. Formula as mentioned in the Rule-book will remain same.
2. Direction of attaching the Fruits will begin from the Trees side facing e-Yantra in clockwise fashion as already mentioned in the rulebook.
3. In the finals teams will be getting Trees of 4.25 inches of diameter due to unavailability of the 4 inch ones. Teams are advised to make slight changes regarding the same. Moreover the practice arena for the same will open a day before the competition hence teams can also calibrate here at IIT Bombay.

je1qcj62ybh60s,Pinned,      URGENT: Task 4-Bonus Configuration,"Dear Participants,
 
In bonus configuration, you should follow only the image given in the configuration PDF file itself i.e. for bonus task you should ignore the rulebook rule that Fruits are to be placed in clockwise fashion starting from the Tree side facing e-Yantra logo (just this time, rule stands as it is.)
I hope this is clear. Please let me know if there's any issue.
